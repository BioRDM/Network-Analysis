The novel model organism Ostreococcus tauri is the smallest free-living eukaryote known to date, and possesses a greatly reduced genome size and cellular complexity, manifested by the presence of just one of most organelles (mitochondrion, chloroplast, golgi stack) per cell, and a genome containing only ~8000 genes. Furthermore, the combination of unicellularity and easy culture provides a platform amenable to chemical biology approaches. Recently, Ostreococcus has been successfully employed to study basic mechanisms underlying circadian timekeeping. Results from this model organism have impacted not only plant science, but also mammalian biology. This example highlights how rapid experimentation in a simple eukaryote from the green lineage can accelerate research in more complex organisms by generating testable hypotheses using methods technically feasible only in this background of reduced complexity. Knowledge of a genome and the possibility to modify genes are essential tools in any model species. Genomic, Transcriptomic, and Proteomic information for this species is freely available, whereas the previously reported methods to genetically transform Ostreococcus are known to few laboratories worldwide. In this article, the experimental methods to genetically transform this novel model organism with an overexpression construct by means of electroporation are outlined in detail, as well as the method of inclusion of transformed cells in low percentage agarose to allow selection of transformed lines originating from a single transformed cell. Following the successful application of Ostreococcus to circadian research, growing interest in Ostreococcus can be expected from diverse research areas within and outside plant sciences, including biotechnological areas. Researchers from a broad range of biological and medical sciences that work on conserved biochemical pathways may consider pursuing research in Ostreococcus, free from the genomic and organismal complexity of larger model species.","2012","2025-01-31 15:33:00","2025-01-31 15:33:00","","e4074","","65","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22825291","","","Edition: 2012/07/25","","","","*Genome, Plant; *Transformation, Genetic; Chlorophyta/*genetics; DNA, Plant/genetics; Electroporation/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therapies that target the 'host' biological processes in infectious diseases are often limited to the use of vaccines and biologics rather than small molecules. The development of host drug targets for small molecules is constrained by a limited knowledge of the underlying role of each target, particularly its potential to cause harmful side effects after targeting. By considering the combinatorial complexity of pathways from the outset, we can develop modeling tools that are better suited to analyzing large pathways, enabling us to identify new causal relationships. This could lead to new drug target strategies that beneficially disrupt host-pathogen interactions, minimizing the number of side effects. We introduce logic theory as part of a pathway modeling approach that can provide a new framework for understanding pathways and refine 'host-based' drug target identification strategies.","2010-02","2025-01-31 15:33:00","2025-01-31 15:33:00","","163-76","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20143942","","","Edition: 2010/02/11","","","","*Gene Expression Regulation; *Host-Pathogen Interactions; *Infection; *Signal Transduction; Humans; Systems Biology/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its ability to grow at atmospheric pressure allows for both easy genetic manipulation and culture, making it a model organism to study piezophily. Here, we report a shotgun proteomic analysis of P. profundum grown at atmospheric compared to high pressure using label-free quantitation and mass spectrometry analysis. We have identified differentially expressed proteins involved in high pressure adaptation, which have been previously reported using other methods. Proteins involved in key metabolic pathways were also identified as being differentially expressed. Proteins involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were up-regulated at high pressure. Conversely, several proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway were up-regulated at atmospheric pressure. Some of the proteins that were differentially identified are regulated directly in response to the physical impact of pressure. The expression of some proteins involved in nutrient transport or assimilation, are likely to be directly regulated by pressure.

RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel robustness analysis that aims to determine the ""common robustness"" of the model with multiple, biologically plausible parameter sets, rather than the local robustness for a particular parameter set. Our method is applied to two published models of the Arabidopsis circadian clock (the one-loop [1] and two-loop [2] models). The results reinforce current findings suggesting the greater reliability of the two-loop model and pinpoint the crucial role of TOC1 in the circadian network.

These properties should be recapitulated in computational models of the circadian clock. Highly nonlinear kinetics and multiple loops are often incorporated into models to match experimental time-series data, but these also impact on model properties for clock models. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we study the consequences of complicated structure and nonlinearity using simple Goodwin-type oscillators and the complex Arabidopsis circadian clock models. Sensitivity analysis of the simple oscillators implies that an interlocked multi-loop structure reinforces sensitivity/robustness properties, enhancing the response to external and internal variations. Furthermore, we found that reducing the degree of nonlinearity could sometimes enhance the robustness of models, implying that ad hoc incorporation of nonlinearity could be detrimental to a model's perceived credibility. CONCLUSION: The correct multi-loop structure and degree of nonlinearity are therefore critical in contributing to the desired properties of a model as well as its capacity to match experimental data.","2010","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","e13867","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21152419","","","Edition: 2010/12/15","","","","Algorithms; *Models, Biological; Arabidopsis/*physiology; Circadian Clocks/*physiology; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; Ecosystem; Feedback, Physiological/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This processing is commonly modelled by permitting mRNA to be transcribed only when the promoter is in the on state. In this simple on/off model, the many processes involved in active transcription are represented by a single reaction. These processes include elongation, which has a minimum time for completion and processing that is not captured in the model. METHODOLOGY: In this paper, we explore the impact on the mRNA distribution of representing the elongation process in more detail. Consideration of the mechanisms of elongation leads to two alternative models of the coupling between the elongating polymerase and the state of the promoter: Processivity allows polymerases to complete elongation irrespective of the promoter state, whereas coupling requires the promoter to be active to produce a full-length transcript. We demonstrate that these alternatives have a significant impact on the predicted distributions. Models are simulated by the Gillespie algorithm, and the third and fourth moments of the resulting distribution are computed in order to characterise the length of the tail, and sharpness of the peak. By this methodology, we show that the moments provide a concise summary of the distribution, showing statistically-significant differences across much of the feasible parameter range. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that processivity is not fully consistent with the on/off model unless the probability of successfully completing elongation is low--as has been observed. The results also suggest that some form of coupling between the promoter and a rate-limiting step in transcription may explain the cell's inability to maintain high mRNA levels at low noise--a prediction of the on/off model that has no supporting evidence.","2010","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","e8845","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20126621","","","Edition: 2010/02/04","","","","*Transcription, Genetic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Messenger/*genetics; Stochastic Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing.

Here we report an intimate link between the innate immune response to infection and regulation of the sterol metabolic network characterized by down-regulation of sterol biosynthesis by an interferon regulatory loop mechanism. In time-series experiments profiling genome-wide lipid-associated gene expression of macrophages, we show a selective and coordinated negative regulation of the complete sterol pathway upon viral infection or cytokine treatment with IFNgamma or beta but not TNF, IL1beta, or IL6. Quantitative analysis at the protein level of selected sterol metabolic enzymes upon infection shows a similar level of suppression. Experimental testing of sterol metabolite levels using lipidomic-based measurements shows a reduction in metabolic output. On the basis of pharmacologic and RNAi inhibition of the sterol pathway we show augmented protection against viral infection, and in combination with metabolite rescue experiments, we identify the requirement of the mevalonate-isoprenoid branch of the sterol metabolic network in the protective response upon statin or IFNbeta treatment. Conditioned media experiments from infected cells support an involvement of secreted type 1 interferon(s) to be sufficient for reducing the sterol pathway upon infection. Moreover, we show that infection of primary macrophages containing a genetic knockout of the major type I interferon, IFNbeta, leads to only a partial suppression of the sterol pathway, while genetic knockout of the receptor for all type I interferon family members, ifnar1, or associated signaling component, tyk2, completely abolishes the reduction of the sterol biosynthetic activity upon infection. Levels of the proteolytically cleaved nuclear forms of SREBP2, a key transcriptional regulator of sterol biosynthesis, are reduced upon infection and IFNbeta treatment at both the protein and de novo transcription level. The reduction in srebf2 gene transcription upon infection and IFN treatment is also found to be strictly dependent on ifnar1. Altogether these results show that type 1 IFN signaling is both necessary and sufficient for reducing the sterol metabolic network activity upon infection, thereby linking the regulation of the sterol pathway with interferon anti-viral defense responses. These findings bring a new link between sterol metabolism and interferon antiviral response and support the idea of using host metabolic modifiers of innate immunity as a potential antiviral strategy.","2011-03","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","e1000598","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21408089","","","Edition: 2011/03/17","","","","Signal Transduction; *Down-Regulation; Animals; Antiviral Agents/pharmacology; Cholesterol/metabolism; Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology/metabolism; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology; Immunity, Innate; Interferon-beta/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology; Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology; Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/virology; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muromegalovirus/*immunology; NIH 3T3 Cells; RNA Interference; Simvastatin/pharmacology; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2/physiology; Sterols/*biosynthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of transcript numbers in individual cells validated the RT-qPCR approach for the average copy-number determination despite the broad distribution of transcript levels within a population of cells. In addition, RT-qPCR was used to distinguish the products of the different steps in splicing of the reporter transcripts, and methods were developed to map and quantify 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation. This system permits pre-mRNA production, splicing, 3'-end maturation and degradation to be quantitatively monitored with unprecedented kinetic detail, suitable for mathematical modeling.

However, in order to study signaling events at molecular level, analysis of changes occurring within minutes is required. We developed an improved approach to separate total cellular RNA into newly transcribed and preexisting RNA following 10-15 min of metabolic labeling. Employing new computational tools for array normalization and half-life determination we simultaneously study short-term RNA synthesis and decay as well as their impact on cellular transcript levels. As an example we studied the response of fibroblasts to type I and II interferons (IFN). Analysis of RNA transcribed within 15-30 min at different times during the first three hours of interferon-receptor activation resulted in a >10-fold increase in microarray sensitivity and provided a comprehensive profile of the kinetics of IFN-mediated changes in gene expression.

However, cell-type specific and patient-to-patient variability in response to SERMs (from suppression to stimulation of cancer growth), as well as frequent emergence of drug resistance, represents a serious problem. The molecular processes behind mixed effects of SERMs remain poorly understood, and this strongly motivates application of systems approaches. In this work, we aimed to establish a mathematical model of ER-dependent gene expression to explore potential mechanisms underlying the variable actions of SERMs. RESULTS: We developed an equilibrium model of ER binding with 17beta-estradiol, tamoxifen and DNA, and linked it to a simple ODE model of ER-induced gene expression. The model was parameterised on the broad range of literature available experimental data, and provided a plausible mechanistic explanation for the dual agonism/antagonism action of tamoxifen in the reference cell line used for model calibration. To extend our conclusions to other cell types we ran global sensitivity analysis and explored model behaviour in the wide range of biologically plausible parameter values, including those found in cancer cells. Our findings suggest that transcriptional response to tamoxifen is controlled in a complex non-linear way by several key parameters, including ER expression level, hormone concentration, amount of ER-responsive genes and the capacity of ER-tamoxifen complexes to stimulate transcription (e.g. by recruiting co-regulators of transcription). The model revealed non-monotonic dependence of ER-induced transcriptional response on the expression level of ER, that was confirmed experimentally in four variants of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. CONCLUSIONS: We established a minimal mechanistic model of ER-dependent gene expression, that predicts complex non-linear effects in transcriptional response to tamoxifen in the broad range of biologically plausible parameter values. Our findings suggest that the outcome of a SERM's action is defined by several key components of cellular micro-environment, that may contribute to cell-type-specific effects of SERMs and justify the need for the development of combinatorial biomarkers for more accurate prediction of the efficacy of SERMs in specific cell types.","2012","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","138","","","6","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","23134774","","","Edition: 2012/11/09","","","","Humans; *Models, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; *Nonlinear Dynamics; Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism; Estrogens/genetics/*metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects; HEK293 Cells; Response Elements/drug effects; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*pharmacology; Tamoxifen/*pharmacology; Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects; Transcriptome/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recently published Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) proposes a minimal set of information that should be provided to allow the reproduction of simulation experiments among users and software tools. RESULTS: In this article, we present the Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML). SED-ML encodes in a computer-readable exchange format the information required by MIASE to enable reproduction of simulation experiments. It has been developed as a community project and it is defined in a detailed technical specification and additionally provides an XML schema. The version of SED-ML described in this publication is Level 1 Version 1. It covers the description of the most frequent type of simulation experiments in the area, namely time course simulations. SED-ML documents specify which models to use in an experiment, modifications to apply on the models before using them, which simulation procedures to run on each model, what analysis results to output, and how the results should be presented. These descriptions are independent of the underlying model implementation. SED-ML is a software-independent format for encoding the description of simulation experiments; it is not specific to particular simulation tools. Here, we demonstrate that with the growing software support for SED-ML we can effectively exchange executable simulation descriptions. CONCLUSIONS: With SED-ML, software can exchange simulation experiment descriptions, enabling the validation and reuse of simulation experiments in different tools. Authors of papers reporting simulation experiments can make their simulation protocols available for other scientists to reproduce the results. Because SED-ML is agnostic about exact modeling language(s) used, experiments covering models from different fields of research can be accurately described and combined.","2011","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","198","","","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22172142","","","Edition: 2011/12/17","","","","Reproducibility of Results; *Computer Simulation; *Programming Languages; *Software; Computational Biology/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key challenge is to identify the structures in biological circuits that confer system-level properties such as robustness. Circadian clocks allow organisms to adapt to the predictable changes of the 24-hour day/night cycle by generating endogenous rhythms that can be entrained to the external cycle. In all organisms, the clock circuits typically comprise multiple interlocked feedback loops controlling the rhythmic expression of key genes. Previously, we showed that such architectures increase the flexibility of the clock's rhythmic behaviour. We now test the relationship between flexibility and robustness, using a mathematical model of the circuit controlling conidiation in the fungus Neurospora crassa. RESULTS: The circuit modelled in this work consists of a central negative feedback loop, in which the frequency (frq) gene inhibits its transcriptional activator white collar-1 (wc-1), interlocked with a positive feedback loop in which FRQ protein upregulates WC-1 production. Importantly, our model reproduces the observed entrainment of this circuit under light/dark cycles with varying photoperiod and cycle duration. Our simulations show that whilst the level of frq mRNA is driven directly by the light input, the falling phase of FRQ protein, a molecular correlate of conidiation, maintains a constant phase that is uncoupled from the times of dawn and dusk. The model predicts the behaviour of mutants that uncouple WC-1 production from FRQ's positive feedback, and shows that the positive loop enhances the buffering of conidiation phase against seasonal photoperiod changes. This property is quantified using Kitano's measure for the overall robustness of a regulated system output. Further analysis demonstrates that this functional robustness is a consequence of the greater evolutionary flexibility conferred on the circuit by the interlocking loop structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that the behaviour of the fungal clock in light-dark cycles can be accounted for by a transcription-translation feedback model of the central FRQ-WC oscillator. More generally, we provide an example of a biological circuit in which greater flexibility yields improved robustness, while also introducing novel sensitivity analysis techniques applicable to a broader range of cellular oscillators.","2010","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","88","","","4","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20576110","","","Edition: 2010/06/26","","","","Computer Simulation; *Models, Biological; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; Feedback, Physiological/physiology; Biological Clocks/*physiology; Fungal Proteins/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology; Homeostasis/*physiology; Neurospora crassa/*physiology; Photoperiod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Manual curation of the published literature was carried out in order to define the components of these pathways and the interactions between them. This information has been assembled into a large integrated directional network and represented graphically using the modified Edinburgh Pathway Notation (mEPN) scheme. RESULTS: The diagram includes detailed views of the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, other pathogen recognition systems, NF-kappa-B, apoptosis, interferon signalling, MAP-kinase cascades, MHC antigen presentation and proteasome assembly, as well as selected views of the transcriptional networks they regulate. The integrated pathway includes a total of 496 unique proteins, the complexes formed between them and the processes in which they are involved. This produces a network of 2,170 nodes connected by 2,553 edges. CONCLUSIONS: The pathway diagram is a navigable visual aid for displaying a consensus view of the pathway information available for these systems. It is also a valuable resource for computational modelling and aid in the interpretation of functional genomics data. We envisage that this work will be of value to those interested in macrophage biology and also contribute to the ongoing Systems Biology community effort to develop a standard notation scheme for the graphical representation of biological pathways.","2010","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","63","","","4","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20470404","","","Edition: 2010/05/18","","","","*Audiovisual Aids; Gene Regulatory Networks/*immunology; Interferons/metabolism; Macrophage Activation/*immunology; MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology; NF-kappa B/metabolism; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism; Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods; Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current systems biology has accumulated much data on mutations with large effects and can predict the properties of knockout mutants in some systems. However experimental methods are too insensitive to observe small effects. RESULTS: Here I propose a novel framework that brings together evolutionary theory and current systems biology approaches in order to quantify small effects of mutations and their epistatic interactions in silico. Central to this approach is the definition of fitness correlates that can be computed in some current systems biology models employing the rigorous algorithms that are at the core of much work in computational systems biology. The framework exploits synergies between the realism of such models and the need to understand real systems in evolutionary theory. This framework can address many longstanding topics in evolutionary biology by defining various 'levels' of the adaptive landscape. Addressed topics include the distribution of mutational effects on fitness, as well as the nature of advantageous mutations, epistasis and robustness. Combining corresponding parameter estimates with population genetics models raises the possibility of testing evolutionary hypotheses at a new level of realism. CONCLUSION: EvoSysBio is expected to lead to a more detailed understanding of the fundamental principles of life by combining knowledge about well-known biological systems from several disciplines. This will benefit both evolutionary theory and current systems biology. Understanding robustness by analysing distributions of mutational effects and epistasis is pivotal for drug design, cancer research, responsible genetic engineering in synthetic biology and many other practical applications.","2009","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","27","","","3","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19239699","","","Edition: 2009/02/26","","","","Systems Biology/*methods; *Models, Genetic; *Algorithms; *Biological Evolution; Adaptation, Biological/*genetics; Genetics, Population; Genomics/*methods; Mutation/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular regulation of this response has been studied in great detail but comprehensive and unambiguous diagrams describing these events are generally unavailable. Four key signalling cascades triggered early-on in the innate immune response are the toll-like receptor, interferon, NF-kappaB and apoptotic pathways, which co-operate to defend cells against a given pathogen. However, these pathways are commonly viewed as separate entities rather than an integrated network of molecular interactions. RESULTS: Here we describe the construction of a logically represented pathway diagram which attempts to integrate these four pathways central to innate immunity using a modified version of the Edinburgh Pathway Notation. The pathway map is available in a number of electronic formats and editing is supported by yEd graph editor software. CONCLUSION: The map presents a powerful visual aid for interpreting the available pathway interaction knowledge and underscores the valuable contribution well constructed pathway diagrams make to communicating large amounts of molecular interaction data. Furthermore, we discuss issues with the limitations and scalability of pathways presented in this fashion, explore options for automated layout of large pathway networks and demonstrate how such maps can aid the interpretation of functional studies.","2008","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","36","","","2","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","18433497","","","Edition: 2008/04/25","","","","Systems Biology/*methods; *Models, Biological; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Interferons/metabolism; NF-kappa B/metabolism; Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism; Audiovisual Aids; Bone Marrow; Cells, Cultured; Computer Graphics; Immunity, Innate/physiology; Logic; Macrophage Activation/*physiology; Male; Monocytes/immunology; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/immunology/metabolism; Protein Interaction Mapping/methods; Signal Transduction/*immunology; Systems Integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present optimised manual and automated protocols for the extraction of total RNA from 9-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings in a 96 well plate format using silica membrane-based methodology. Consistent and reproducible yields of high quality RNA are isolated averaging 8.9 mug total RNA per sample (~20 mg plant tissue). The purified RNA is suitable for subsequent qPCR analysis of the expression of over 500 genes in triplicate from each sample. Using the automated procedure, 192 samples (2 x 96 well plates) can easily be fully processed (samples homogenised, RNA purified and quantified) in less than half a day. Additionally we demonstrate that plant samples can be stored in RNAlater at -20 degrees C (but not 4 degrees C) for 10 months prior to extraction with no significant effect on RNA yield or quality. Additionally, disrupted samples can be stored in the lysis buffer at -20 degrees C for at least 6 months prior to completion of the extraction procedure providing a flexible sampling and storage scheme to facilitate complex time series experiments.","2011","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","40","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22136293","","","Edition: 2011/12/06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we have used targeted RNA interference to suppress the expression of a number of key genes associated with IFN signalling in murine macrophages prior to stimulation with interferon-gamma. Genome-wide changes in transcript abundance caused by siRNA activity were measured using exon-level microarrays in the presence or absence of IFNgamma. RESULTS: Transfection of murine bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) with a non-targeting (control) siRNA and 11 sequence-specific siRNAs was performed using a cationic lipid transfection reagent (Lipofectamine2000) prior to stimulation with IFNgamma. Total RNA was harvested from cells and gene expression measured on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. Network-based analysis of these data revealed six siRNAs to cause a marked shift in the macrophage transcriptome in the presence or absence IFNgamma. These six siRNAs targeted the Ifnb1, Irf3, Irf5, Stat1, Stat2 and Nfkb2 transcripts. The perturbation of the transcriptome by the six siRNAs was highly similar in each case and affected the expression of over 600 downstream transcripts. Regulated transcripts were clustered based on co-expression into five major groups corresponding to transcriptional networks associated with the type I and II IFN response, cell cycle regulation, and NF-KB signalling. In addition we have observed a significant non-specific immune stimulation of cells transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine2000, suggesting use of this reagent in BMDMs, even at low concentrations, is enough to induce a type I IFN response. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the type I IFN response in murine BMDMs is dependent on Ifnb1, Irf3, Irf5, Stat1, Stat2 and Nfkb2, and that siRNAs targeted to these genes results in perturbation of key transcriptional networks associated with type I and type II IFN signalling and a suppression of macrophage M1 polarization.","2009","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","372","","","10","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19664281","","","Edition: 2009/08/12","","","","Promoter Regions, Genetic; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Gene Expression Profiling/*methods; Cells, Cultured; Male; *Gene Regulatory Networks; *RNA Interference; Binding Sites; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Genome-Wide Association Study/methods; Interferon-gamma/*metabolism; Macrophages/*metabolism; Multigene Family; RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism; Transcription Factors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: Here we show that proteomic analyses largely benefit from using separate treatment of peptides matching to proteins alone or in groups based on locally estimated false discovery rates. Our implementation reduces the number of false positives and simultaneously increases the number of proteins identified. Importantly, single peptide identifications achieve defined confidence and the sequence coverage of proteins is optimized. As a result, we improve the number of proteins identified in a human serum analysis by 58% without compromising identification confidence.

The analysis of the resulting data tests the limits of existing bioinformatics computing infrastructure. A solution to this issue is to use High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which contain many processors and more memory than desktop computer systems. Many biostatisticians use R to process the data gleaned from microarray analysis and there is even a dedicated group of packages, Bioconductor, for this purpose. However, to exploit HPC systems, R must be able to utilise the multiple processors available on these systems. There are existing modules that enable R to use multiple processors, but these are either difficult to use for the HPC novice or cannot be used to solve certain classes of problems. A method of exploiting HPC systems, using R, but without recourse to mastering parallel programming paradigms is therefore necessary to analyse genomic data to its fullest. RESULTS: We have designed and built a prototype framework that allows the addition of parallelised functions to R to enable the easy exploitation of HPC systems. The Simple Parallel R INTerface (SPRINT) is a wrapper around such parallelised functions. Their use requires very little modification to existing sequential R scripts and no expertise in parallel computing. As an example we created a function that carries out the computation of a pairwise calculated correlation matrix. This performs well with SPRINT. When executed using SPRINT on an HPC resource of eight processors this computation reduces by more than three times the time R takes to complete it on one processor. CONCLUSION: SPRINT allows the biostatistician to concentrate on the research problems rather than the computation, while still allowing exploitation of HPC systems. It is easy to use and with further development will become more useful as more functions are added to the framework.","2008","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","558","","","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19114001","","","Edition: 2008/12/31","","","","Humans; Algorithms; Animals; *Software; Computational Biology/*methods; Computer Graphics; *Computing Methodologies; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling/methods; Genomics; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Programming Languages; User-Computer Interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The implementation of ISSF allows standard simulation software to reproduce specialized circadian protocols, such as the phase-response curve. To facilitate the reuse of this function in public models, the authors have developed software to configure its behavior without any specialist knowledge of SBML.

Systems biology approaches lend themselves to rapid in silico testing of factors, which may confer resistance to targeted therapies. Inthis study, we aimed to develop a new kinetic model that could be interrogated to predict resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor therapies and directly test predictions in vitro and in clinical samples. The new mathematical model included RTK inhibitor antibody binding, HER2/HER3 dimerization and inhibition, AKT/mitogen-activated protein kinase cross-talk, and the regulatory properties of PTEN. The model was parameterized using quantitative phosphoprotein expression data from cancer cell lines using reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative PTEN protein expression was found to be the key determinant of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in silico, which was predictive of unseen experiments in vitro using the PTEN inhibitor bp(V). When measured in cancer cell lines, PTEN expression predicts sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy; furthermore, this quantitative measurement is more predictive of response (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.5; P < 0.0001) than other pathway components taken in isolation and when tested by multivariate analysis in a cohort of 122 breast cancers treated with trastuzumab. For the first time, a systems biology approach has successfully been used to stratify patients for personalized therapy in cancer and is further compelling evidence that PTEN, appropriately measured in the clinical setting, refines clinical decision making in patients treated with anti-HER2 therapies.","2009-08-15","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","6713-20","","16","69","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19638581","","","Edition: 2009/07/30","","","","Humans; Algorithms; Models, Theoretical; Models, Biological; *Individuality; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use; Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use; Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics; Female; Genes, erbB-2; Middle Aged; Prognosis; PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*physiology; Systems Biology/*methods/trends; Tumor Cells, Cultured","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This developmental asymmetry arises because the expression of the HO endonuclease, which initiates the interconversion of a and alpha mating type cassettes, is extinguished by the daughter-specific Ash1 transcriptional repressor. When daughters become mothers in the subsequent cell cycle, Ash1 must be eliminated to enable a new developmental state. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Cdc4) mediates the phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1. The inactivation of SCF(Cdc4) stabilizes Ash1 in vivo, and consistently, Ash1 binds to and is ubiquitinated by SCF(Cdc4) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in vitro. The mutation of a critical in vivo cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation site (Thr290) on Ash1 reduces its ubiquitination and rate of degradation in vivo and decreases the frequency of mating type switching. Ash1 associates with active Cdc28 kinase in vivo and is targeted to SCF(Cdc4) in a Cdc28-dependent fashion in vivo and in vitro. Ash1 recognition by Cdc4 appears to be mediated by at least three phosphorylation sites that form two redundant diphosphorylated degrons. The phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system thus underpins developmental asymmetry in budding yeast.","2011-02","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","584-98","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21098119","","","Edition: 2010/11/26","","","","*Transcription, Genetic; Cell Cycle; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism; Phosphorylation; *Genes, Mating Type, Fungal; Amino Acid Sequence; CDC28 Protein Kinase, S cerevisiae/metabolism; Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism; F-Box Proteins/*metabolism; Gene Silencing; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphothreonine/metabolism; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protein Stability; Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*enzymology/*genetics; Ubiquitination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Type I interferon (alpha/beta interferon [IFN-alpha/beta]) and type II interferon (IFN-gamma) play a crucial role in activating macrophages and subsequently restricting viral infections. Both types of IFNs signal through related but distinct signaling pathways, inducing a vast number of interferon-stimulated genes that are overlapping but distinguishable. The exact mechanism by which IFNs, particularly IFN-gamma, inhibit DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) is still not fully understood. Here, we investigate the antiviral state developed in macrophages upon reversible inhibition of murine CMV by IFN-gamma. On the basis of molecular profiling of the reversible inhibition, we identify a significant contribution of a restricted type I IFN subnetwork linked with IFN-gamma activation. Genetic knockout of the type I-signaling pathway, in the context of IFN-gamma stimulation, revealed an essential requirement for a primed type I-signaling process in developing a full refractory state in macrophages. A minimal transient induction of IFN-beta upon macrophage activation with IFN-gamma is also detectable. In dose and kinetic viral replication inhibition experiments with IFN-gamma, the establishment of an antiviral effect is demonstrated to occur within the first hours of infection. We show that the inhibitory mechanisms at these very early times involve a blockade of the viral major immediate-early promoter activity. Altogether our results show that a primed type I IFN subnetwork contributes to an immediate-early antiviral state induced by type II IFN activation of macrophages, with a potential further amplification loop contributed by transient induction of IFN-beta.","2011-10","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","10286-99","","19","85","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21775459","","","Edition: 2011/07/22","","","","Signal Transduction; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Time Factors; Interferon Type I/*immunology; Interferon-gamma/*immunology; Macrophage Activation; Macrophages/*immunology/*virology; Muromegalovirus/*growth & development/*immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Detailed understanding of the circadian network of higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, is hampered by the high number of partially redundant genes. However, the picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri, which was recently shown to possess a small number of non-redundant clock genes, presents an attractive alternative target for detailed modelling of circadian clocks in the green lineage. Based on extensive time-series data from in vivo reporter gene assays, we developed a model of the Ostreococcus clock as a feedback loop between the genes TOC1 and CCA1. The model reproduces the dynamics of the transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. Surprisingly, the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when the light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock circuit, it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions. Systematic screening of the effects of altered day length revealed a complex relationship between phase and photoperiod, which is also captured by the model. The complex light response is shown to stem from circadian gating of light-dependent mechanisms. This study provides insights into the contributions of light inputs to the Ostreococcus clock. The model suggests that a high number of light-dependent reactions are important for flexible timing in a circadian clock with only one feedback loop.","2011-04","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","375-85","","2","66","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21219507","","","Edition: 2011/01/12","","","","Models, Biological; Photoperiod; Transcription Factors/metabolism; *Circadian Clocks; Chlorophyta/genetics/physiology/*radiation effects; CLOCK Proteins/genetics/*radiation effects; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Light; Plant Proteins/genetics/*radiation effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary PD are laid down at cytokinesis, while secondary PD arise during wall extension. During leaf development, the basal cell walls of trichomes extend radially without division, providing a convenient system for studying the origin of secondary PD. We devised a simple freeze-fracture protocol for examining large numbers of PD in surface view. In the postcytokinetic wall, simple PD were distributed randomly. As the wall extended, PD became twinned at the cell periphery. Additional secondary pores were inserted at right angles to these, giving rise to pit fields composed of several paired PD. During wall extension, the number of PD increased fivefold due to the insertion of secondary PD. Our data are consistent with a model in which a subset of the original primary PD pores function as templates for the insertion of new secondary PD, spatially fixing the position of future pit fields. Many of the new PD shared the same wall collar as the original PD pore, suggesting that new PD pores may arise by fissions of existing PD progenitors. Different models of secondary PD formation are discussed. Our data are supported by a computational model, Plasmodesmap, which accurately simulates the formation of radial pit fields during cell wall extension based on the occurrence of multiple PD twinning events in the cell wall. The model predicts PD distributions with striking resemblance to those seen on fractured wall faces.","2008-06","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","1504-18","","6","20","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","18667640","","","Edition: 2008/08/01","","","","Computer Simulation; *Models, Biological; Cell Wall/metabolism/ultrastructure; Cytokinesis; Freeze Fracturing; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Plasmodesmata/*metabolism/ultrastructure; Tobacco/*metabolism/ultrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD; a flexible tail-like extension of the largest subunit) couples pre-messenger RNA capping, splicing and 3' end maturation to transcriptional elongation and termination, and plays a central role in integrating these processes. The phosphorylation states of the serine residues of many heptapeptide repeats of the CTD alter along the coding region of genes as a function of distance from the promoter. From a mechanistic perspective, both the changes in phosphorylation and the location at which they take place on the genes are a function of the time spent by RNAPII in elongation as this interval provides the opportunity for the kinases and phosphatases to interact with the CTD.

The clock functions by generating endogenous rhythms that can be entrained to the external 24-h day-night cycle, enabling organisms to optimally time biochemical processes relative to dawn and dusk. In recent years, computational models based on differential equations have become useful tools for dissecting and quantifying the complex regulatory relationships underlying the clock's oscillatory dynamics. However, optimizing the large parameter sets characteristic of these models places intense demands on both computational and experimental resources, limiting the scope of in silico studies. Here, we develop an approach based on Boolean logic that dramatically reduces the parametrization, making the state and parameter spaces finite and tractable. We introduce efficient methods for fitting Boolean models to molecular data, successfully demonstrating their application to synthetic time courses generated by a number of established clock models, as well as experimental expression levels measured using luciferase imaging. Our results indicate that despite their relative simplicity, logic models can (i) simulate circadian oscillations with the correct, experimentally observed phase relationships among genes and (ii) flexibly entrain to light stimuli, reproducing the complex responses to variations in daylength generated by more detailed differential equation formulations. Our work also demonstrates that logic models have sufficient predictive power to identify optimal regulatory structures from experimental data. By presenting the first Boolean models of circadian circuits together with general techniques for their optimization, we hope to establish a new framework for the systematic modelling of more complex clocks, as well as other circuits with different qualitative dynamics. In particular, we anticipate that the ability of logic models to provide a computationally efficient representation of system behaviour could greatly facilitate the reverse-engineering of large-scale biochemical networks.","2012-09-07","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","2365-82","","74","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22499125","","","Edition: 2012/04/14","","","","*Models, Biological; Arabidopsis/*physiology; Circadian Clocks/*physiology; Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology; *Photoperiod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The computational modelling language Bio-PEPA enabled us to give a stochastic interpretation of an existing deterministic model of the clock, and to easily compare the results obtained via stochastic simulation and via numerical solution of the deterministic model. First, the introduction of stochasticity in the model allowed us to estimate the unknown size of the system. Moreover, stochasticity improved the description of the available experimental data in several light conditions: noise-induced fluctuations yield a faster entrainment of the plant clock under certain photoperiods and are able to explain the experimentally observed dampening of the oscillations in plants under constant light conditions. The model predicts that the desynchronization between noisy oscillations in single cells contributes to the observed damped oscillations at the level of the cell population.

IFNgamma-induced repression of genes associated with regulation of gene expression, cellular development, apoptosis and cell growth resulted from cycloheximide-resistant primary IFNgamma signalling. In silico promoter analysis revealed significant overrepresentation of SP1/SP3-binding sites and/or GC-rich stretches. Although signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-binding sites were not overrepresented, repression was lost in absence of STAT1. Interestingly, basal expression of the majority of these IFNgamma-repressed genes was dependent on STAT1 in IFN-naive fibroblasts.

The enzyme responsible for extension of the telomere 3' terminus is the ribonucleoprotein telomerase. Whereas telomerase activity can be reconstituted in vitro with only the telomerase RNA (hTR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), additional components are required in vivo for enzyme assembly, stability and telomere extension activity. One such associated protein, dyskerin, promotes hTR stability in vivo and is the only component to co-purify with active, endogenous human telomerase. We used oligonucleotide-based affinity purification of hTR followed by native gel electrophoresis and in-gel telomerase activity detection to query the composition of telomerase at different purification stringencies. At low salt concentrations (0.1 M NaCl), affinity-purified telomerase was 'supershifted' with an anti-dyskerin antibody, however the association with dyskerin was lost after purification at 0.6 M NaCl, despite the retention of telomerase activity and a comparable yield of hTR. The interaction of purified hTR and dyskerin in vitro displayed a similar salt-sensitive interaction. These results demonstrate that endogenous human telomerase, once assembled and active, does not require dyskerin for catalytic activity. Native gel electrophoresis may prove useful in the characterization of telomerase complexes under various physiological conditions.","2012-03","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","e36","","5","40","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22187156","","","Edition: 2011/12/22","","","","Humans; *Electrophoresis; Antibodies; Cell Cycle Proteins/immunology/*metabolism; Cell Line, Tumor; Nuclear Proteins/immunology/*metabolism; Oligonucleotides; Sodium Chloride/chemistry; Telomerase/analysis/*isolation & purification/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For networks of small/medium scale, the dominant paradigm is represented by systems of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). ODEs afford great mechanistic detail and flexibility, but calibrating these models to data is often an extremely difficult statistical problem. RESULTS: Here, we develop a general statistical inference framework for stochastic transcription-translation networks. We use a coarse-grained approach, which represents the system as a network of stochastic (binary) promoter and (continuous) protein variables. We derive an exact inference algorithm and an efficient variational approximation that allows scalable inference and learning of the model parameters. We demonstrate the power of the approach on two biological case studies, showing that the method allows a high degree of flexibility and is capable of testable novel biological predictions.Availability and implementation: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gsanguin/software.html.

Not only do they frequently require a high level of computational power, but the software needed to run the experiment needs to be usable by scientists with varying levels of computational expertise, and modellers need to be able to obtain up-to-date experimental data resources easily. We have developed a software suite, the Systems Biology Software Infrastructure (SBSI), to facilitate the parameter-fitting process. SBSI is a modular software suite composed of three major components: SBSINumerics, a high-performance library containing parallelized algorithms for performing parameter fitting; SBSIDispatcher, a middleware application to track experiments and submit jobs to back-end servers; and SBSIVisual, an extensible client application used to configure optimization experiments and view results. Furthermore, we have created a plugin infrastructure to enable project-specific modules to be easily installed. Plugin developers can take advantage of the existing user-interface and application framework to customize SBSI for their own uses, facilitated by SBSI's use of standard data formats. Availability and implementation: All SBSI binaries and source-code are freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbsi under an Apache 2 open-source license. The server-side SBSINumerics runs on any Unix-based operating system; both SBSIVisual and SBSIDispatcher are written in Java and are platform independent, allowing use on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

The method is based on a mixture model, using latent variables to assign individual measurements to different classes. The practical inference follows the Bayesian paradigm and samples the network structure, the number of classes and the assignment of latent variables from the posterior distribution with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using the recently proposed allocation sampler as an alternative to RJMCMC. RESULTS: We have evaluated the method using three criteria: network reconstruction, statistical significance and biological plausibility. In terms of network reconstruction, we found improved results both for a synthetic network of known structure and for a small real regulatory network derived from the literature. We have assessed the statistical significance of the improvement on gene expression time series for two different systems (viral challenge of macrophages, and circadian rhythms in plants), where the proposed new scheme tends to outperform the classical BGe score. Regarding biological plausibility, we found that the inference results obtained with the proposed method were in excellent agreement with biological findings, predicting dichotomies that one would expect to find in the studied systems.

Particularly, relevant human pathologies such as cancer or viral infections require downregulating apoptosis signaling pathways to progress. As a result, the identification of proteins responsible for these changes is essential for the diagnostics and development of therapeutics. Transferring functional annotation within protein interaction networks has proven useful to identify such proteins, although this is not a trivial task. Here, we used different scoring methods to transfer annotation from 53 well-studied members of the human apoptosis pathways (as known by 2005) to their protein interactors. All scoring methods produced significant predictions (compared to a random negative model), but its number was too large to be useful. Thus, we made a final prediction using specific combinations of scoring methods and compared it to the proteins related to apoptosis signaling pathways during the last 5 years. We propose 273 candidate proteins that may be relevant in apoptosis signaling pathways.

Consequently, we constructed a reporter system that splices cotranscriptionally and can be monitored in live cells and in real time through the use of MS2-GFP. All small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are loaded on nascent pre-mRNAs, and spliceostatin A inhibits splicing but not snRNP recruitment. Intron removal occurs in minutes and is best described by a model where several successive steps are rate limiting. Each pre-mRNA molecule is predicted to require a similar time to splice, reducing kinetic noise and improving the regulation of alternative splicing.

This report investigates the inference of Boolean networks with perturbation (BNp) from simulated data and observed microarray data. We interpret the discrete expression levels as attractor states of the underlying network and use the sequence of attractor states to determine the model. We consider the case where a complete sequence of attractors is known and the case where the known attractor states are arrived at by sampling from an underlying sequence of attractors. In the former case, a BNp can be inferred trivially, for an arbitrary number of genes and attractors. In the latter case, we use the constraints posed by the distribution of attractor states and the need to conserve probability to arrive at one of three possible solutions: an unique, exact network; several exact networks or a 'most-likely' network. In the case of several exact networks we use a robustness requirement to select a preferred network. In the case that an exact option is not found, we select the network that best fits the observed attractor distribution. We apply the resulting algorithm to the interferon regulatory network using expression data taken from murine bone-derived macrophage cells infected with cytomegalovirus.","2008-10","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","1024-30","","10","4","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19082142","","","Edition: 2008/12/17","","","","Algorithms; Computer Simulation; *Models, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics; Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics; Interferons/*genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that oxidation-reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms.

In plants, attempted microbial infection triggers the rapid synthesis of nitric oxide and a parallel accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates, the latter generated by NADPH oxidases related to those responsible for the pathogen-activated respiratory burst in phagocytes. Both nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates have been implicated in controlling the hypersensitive response, a programmed execution of plant cells at sites of attempted infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin their function and coordinate their synthesis are unknown. Here we show genetic evidence that increases in cysteine thiols modified using nitric oxide, termed S-nitrosothiols, facilitate the hypersensitive response in the absence of the cell death agonist salicylic acid and the synthesis of reactive oxygen intermediates. Surprisingly, when concentrations of S-nitrosothiols were high, nitric oxide function also governed a negative feedback loop limiting the hypersensitive response, mediated by S-nitrosylation of the NADPH oxidase, AtRBOHD, at Cys 890, abolishing its ability to synthesize reactive oxygen intermediates. Accordingly, mutation of Cys 890 compromised S-nitrosothiol-mediated control of AtRBOHD activity, perturbing the magnitude of cell death development. This cysteine is evolutionarily conserved and specifically S-nitrosylated in both human and fly NADPH oxidase, suggesting that this mechanism may govern immune responses in both plants and animals.","2011-10-13","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","264-8","","7368","478","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21964330","","","Edition: 2011/10/04","","","","Humans; Animals; Mutation; Feedback, Physiological; *Plant Immunity; Apoptosis/*immunology; Arabidopsis Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Arabidopsis/cytology/enzymology/*immunology/*microbiology; Conserved Sequence; Cysteine/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Drosophila melanogaster; Mutant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/metabolism; NADPH Oxidase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Nitric Oxide/metabolism; Plant Cells/*enzymology/*immunology/microbiology/pathology; Pseudomonas syringae/immunology; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Salicylic Acid; Sulfhydryl Compounds/chemistry/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri possesses a naturally minimized clock, which includes many features that are shared with plants, such as a central negative feedback loop that involves the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 genes. Given that recent observations in animals and plants have revealed prominent post-translational contributions to timekeeping, a reappraisal of the transcriptional contribution to oscillator function is overdue. Here we show that non-transcriptional mechanisms are sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage, although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional components. We identify oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in mammals. Moreover we show that pharmacological modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on rhythms in Ostreococcus. Post-translational mechanisms, and at least one rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than transcriptional clock regulators. It is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are non-transcriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria, and are conserved across kingdoms.","2011-01-27","2025-01-31 15:33:01","2025-01-31 15:33:01","","554-8","","7331","469","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21270895","","","Edition: 2011/01/29","","","","Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; *Transcription, Genetic; Oxidation-Reduction; Biological Markers/analysis; Chlorophyta/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology; Cycloheximide/pharmacology; Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; Peroxiredoxins/metabolism; Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our data demonstrate that two cryptochrome photoreceptors differentially control circadian period and sustain rhythmicity across the physiological temperature range.

We introduce a new mathematical model for the Neurospora crassa circadian network incorporating experimental work showing that temperature alters the balance of translation between a short and long form of the FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein.

The model reproduces a broad range of key experimental data on temperature dependence and rhythmicity, both in wild-type and mutant strains.

The major 5.8S 5'-end is generated by Rat1 digestion of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) spacer from cleavage site A(3). Processing from A(3) requires the 'A(3)-cluster' proteins, including Cic1, Erb1, Nop7, Nop12 and Nop15, which show interdependent pre-rRNA binding. Surprisingly, A(3)-cluster factors were not crosslinked close to site A(3), but bound sites around the 5.8S 3'- and 25S 5'-regions, which are base paired in mature ribosomes, and in the ITS2 spacer that separates these rRNAs. In contrast, Nop4, a protein required for endonucleolytic cleavage in ITS1, binds the pre-rRNA near the 5'-end of 5.8S. ITS2 was reported to undergo structural remodelling. In vivo chemical probing indicates that A(3)-cluster binding is required for this reorganization, potentially regulating the timing of processing.

This is a conservative extension meaning that the original syntax of Bio-PEPA is retained and the delay specification which can now be associated with actions may be added to existing Bio-PEPA models. The semantics of the firing of the actions with delays is the delay-as-duration approach, earlier presented in papers on the stochastic simulation of biological systems with delays. This semantics of the algebra is given in the Starting-Terminating style, meaning that the state and the completion of an action are observed as two separate events, as required by delays. We formally define the encoding of Bio-PEPAd systems in Generalized Semi-Markov Processes (GSMPs), as input for a Delay Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (DSSA) and as sets of Delay Differential Equations (DDEs), the deterministic framework for modeling of biological systems with delays.

We illustrate the proposed query-based classification on a number of simple abstract models of biochemical systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, RNA polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced mRNA and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes.

This paper describes the global proteomic study of O. tauri, using mass spectrometry-based approaches: phosphopeptide enrichment, cellular fractionation, label-free quantification and (15)N metabolic labeling. The O. tauri proteome was analyzed under the following conditions: sampling at different times during the circadian cycle, after 24h of illumination, after 24h of darkness and under various nitrogen source supply levels. Cell cycle related proteins such as dynamin and kinesin were significantly up-regulated during the daylight-to-darkness transition. This is reflected by their higher intensity at ZT13 and this transition phase coincides with the end of mitosis. Proteins involved in several metabolic mechanisms were found to be up-regulated under low nitrogen conditions, including carbon storage pathways, glycolysis, phosphate transport, and the synthesis of inorganic polyphosphates. Ostreococcus tauri responds to low nitrogen conditions by reducing its nitrogen assimilation machinery which suggests an atypical adaptation mechanism for coping with a nutrient-limited environment.","2011-09-06","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","2060-70","","10","74","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21635980","","","Edition: 2011/06/04","","","","Proteomics/*methods; Circadian Rhythm; Chlorophyta/*chemistry/metabolism; Phosphopeptides/analysis; Plant Proteins/*analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently global sensitivity analysis (GSA) has been recognised as a useful technique, capable of addressing the uncertainty of the model parameters and generating valid predictions on parametric sensitivities. Here we propose a novel implementation of model-based GSA specially designed to explore how multi-parametric network perturbations affect signal propagation through cancer-related networks. We use area-under-the-curve for time course of changes in phosphorylation of proteins as a characteristic for sensitivity analysis and rank network parameters with regard to their impact on the level of key cancer-related outputs, separating strong inhibitory from stimulatory effects. This allows interpretation of the results in terms which can incorporate the effects of potential anti-cancer drugs on targets and the associated biological markers of cancer. To illustrate the method we applied it to an ErbB signalling network model and explored the sensitivity profile of its key model readout, phosphorylated Akt, in the absence and presence of the ErbB2 inhibitor pertuzumab. The method successfully identified the parameters associated with elevation or suppression of Akt phosphorylation in the ErbB2/3 network. From analysis and comparison of the sensitivity profiles of pAkt in the absence and presence of targeted drugs we derived predictions of drug targets, cancer-related biomarkers and generated hypotheses for combinatorial therapy. Several key predictions have been confirmed in experiments using human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We also compared GSA-derived predictions with the results of local sensitivity analysis and discuss the applicability of both methods. We propose that the developed GSA procedure can serve as a refining tool in combinatorial anti-cancer drug discovery.","2012-07-16","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","244-58","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22085636","","","Edition: 2011/11/17","","","","Humans; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; *Models, Biological; *Systems Biology; Phosphorylation; Female; Time Factors; Cell Line, Tumor; *Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology; Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology; Drug Design; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism; Receptor, erbB-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Receptor, erbB-3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Signal Transduction/*drug effects; Tumor Markers, Biological/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Expanded binds Yorkie at endogenous levels via WW-domain-PPxY interactions, independently of Yorkie phosphorylation at S168, which is critical for 14-3-3 binding. Expanded relocalizes Yorkie from the nucleus, abrogating its nuclear activity, and it can regulate growth downstream of warts in vivo.

More recently, evidence from the unicellular eukaryote Ostreococcus tauri revealed a transcription-independent, rhythmic protein modification shared in anucleate human cells. In this study, the Ostreococcus system reveals a central role for targeted protein degradation in the mechanism of circadian timing. The Ostreococcus clockwork contains a TTFL involving the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 proteins. Cellular CCA1 and TOC1 protein content and degradation rates are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using luciferase reporter fusion proteins. CCA1 protein degradation rates, measured in high time resolution, feature a sharp clock-regulated peak under constant conditions. TOC1 degradation peaks in response to darkness. Targeted protein degradation, unlike transcription and translation, is shown to be essential to sustain TTFL rhythmicity throughout the circadian cycle.

We use cca1-11 lhy-21 elf3-4 plants to separate the repressive function of ELF3 from its downstream targets CCA1 and LHY. We further demonstrate that ELF3 associates physically with the promoter of PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9), a repressor of CCA1 and LHY expression, in a time-dependent fashion. The repressive function of ELF3 is thus consistent with indirect activation of LHY and CCA1, in a double-negative connection via a direct ELF3 target, PRR9.

The hypothesis that the core pacemakers of these clocks consist of auto-regulatory transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) was first developed in flies and fungi and has now been extended successfully to describe circadian timing mechanisms in mammals and plants. TTFL models revolve around the protein products of 'clock' genes that feedback periodically to regulate their own expression. From this simple beginning, the models have been expanded to encompass multiple, interlinked loops. However, experimental data now highlight the limitations of the TTFL model. Until recently, the focus on transcription caused rhythms in cytosolic signalling pathways to be viewed as outputs of the 'core' transcriptional clockwork, or else as a mechanism for its entrainment by extra-cellular stimuli. Recent work in Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals now reveals that cytosolic rhythms in small signalling molecules have a central role within the circadian pacemaker. The logic is consistent across taxa: oscillatory cytoplasmic elements integrate with transcriptional feedback loops to sustain them and determine their rhythmic properties. Thus, clock outputs can constitute inputs to subsequent cycles and so become indistinguishable from a core mechanism. This emphasises the interdependence of nuclear and cytoplasmic processes in circadian pacemaking, such that the pacemakers of some species might encompass the entire cell and its intercellular environment.","2008-09-09","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","R805-R815","","17","18","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","18786386","","","Edition: 2008/09/13","","","","*Circadian Rhythm; Models, Genetic; Signal Transduction; Animals; Feedback, Physiological; Behavior, Animal; Cytosol/*metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, statin based drugs, which form the principle pharmaceutical agents for decreasing the activity of this pathway, target a single enzyme. Here, we build an ordinary differential equation model of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in order to investigate how the two regulatory strategies impact upon the behaviour of the pathway. We employ a modest set of assumptions: that the pathway operates away from saturation, that each metabolite is involved in multiple cellular interactions and that mRNA levels reflect enzyme concentrations. Using data taken from primary bone marrow derived macrophage cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus or treated with IFNgamma, we show that, under these assumptions, coordinate down-regulation of enzyme activity imparts a graduated reduction in flux along the pathway. In contrast, modelling a statin-like treatment that achieves the same degree of down-regulation in cholesterol production, we show that this delivers a step change in flux along the pathway. The graduated reduction mediated by physiological coordinate regulation of multiple enzymes supports a mechanism that allows a greater level of specificity, altering cholesterol levels with less impact upon interactions branching from the pathway, than pharmacological step reductions. We argue that coordinate regulation is likely to show a long-term evolutionary advantage over single enzyme regulation. Finally, the results from our models have implications for future pharmaceutical therapies intended to target cholesterol production with greater specificity and fewer off target effects, suggesting that this can be achieved by mimicking the coordinated down-regulation observed in immunological responses.","2013-03","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","613-21","","3","95","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22664637","","","Edition: 2012/06/06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to being much cheaper and faster than wet experiments, computer simulation has other advantages: it allows us to run experiments in which several species can be monitored at the same time, to explore quickly various conditions by varying species and parameters in different runs, and in some cases to observe the behavior of the system at a greater level of detail than the one permitted by experimental techniques. In the past few years there has been a considerable effort in the computer science community to develop computational languages and software tools for modeling and analysing biochemical systems. Among the challenges which must be addressed in this context, there are: the definition of languages powerful enough to express all the relevant features of biochemical systems, the development of efficient algorithms to analyze models and interpret the results, and the implementation of modeling platforms which are usable by nonprogrammers. In this chapter, we focus on the use of computational modeling to the analysis of biochemical systems. Computational modeling, in conjunction with the use of formal intuitive modeling languages, enables biologists to define models using a notation very similar to the informal descriptions they commonly use, but formal and, hence, automatically executable. We describe the main features of the existing textual computational languages and the tool support available for model development and analysis.","2011","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","217-51","","","487","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21187227","","","Edition: 2010/12/29","","","","Humans; Signal Transduction; *Models, Biological; Animals; *Computer Simulation; Circadian Clocks/physiology; Janus Kinases/physiology; STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A disadvantage of the latter approach is the intrinsic inability to specify the prior probability on network structures explicitly. The relative paucity of different experimental conditions in contemporary systems biology implies a strong influence of the prior probability on the posterior probability and, hence, the outcome of inference. Consequently, the paradigm of performing MCMC proposal moves in order rather than structure space is not entirely satisfactory. In the present article, we propose a new and more extensive edge reversal move in the original structure space, and we show that this significantly improves the convergence of the classical structure MCMC scheme.","2008-06","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","265-305","","2-3","71","","Mach Learn","","","","","","","","English","","","","ISI:000255788300006","","","","","","","bayesian networks; markov-chains; mcmc sampling; structure learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a standard data-dependent approach, we identified some specific peptides from this extract which were also commercially available in their AQUA form (use for absolute quantitation). For some of the peptides, we observed a non-linear response between the intensity and the added quantity which was then fitted using a quadratic fit. All AQUA peptides spiked into a mix of 3 microg of the HeLa cell digest extract were detected down to 16 fmol. We placed an emphasis on peptide detection which, in this study, is performed using a combination of properties such as three specific Q3-like ion signatures (for a given Q1-like selection) and co-elution with the AQUA peptide counterparts. Detecting a peptide without necessarily identifying it using a search engine imposes less constraint in terms of tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra purity. An example is shown where a peptide is detected using those criteria but could not be identified by Mascot due to its lower abundance. To complement this observation, we used a cross-correlation analysis approach in order to separate two populations of MS/MS fragments based on differences in their elution patterns. Such an approach opens the door to new strategies to analyse lower intensity peptide fragments. An in silico analysis of the human trypsinosome allows the evaluation of how unique are the sets of features that we are using for peptide detection.","2010-04-15","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","1093-104","","7","24","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20217656","","","Edition: 2010/03/11","","","","Humans; Computer Simulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Proteomics/methods; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods; Cytoplasm/*chemistry; HeLa Cells; Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Trypsin/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, wet-lab experiments and population genetic methods have been used to infer the sizes of effects of mutations. Both approaches have important limitations. Here we propose a new framework for estimating the DMEF by constructing fitness correlates in molecular systems biology models. This new framework can complement the other approaches in estimating small effects on fitness. We present a notation for the various DMEs that can be present in a molecular systems biology model. Then we apply this new framework to a simple circadian clock model and estimate various DMEs in that system. Circadian clocks are responsible for the daily rhythms of activity in a wide range of organisms. Mutations in the corresponding genes can have large effects on fitness by changing survival or fecundity. We define potential fitness correlates, describe methods for automatically measuring them from simulations and implement a simple clock using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm within StochKit. We determine what fraction of examined mutations with small effects on the rates of the reactions involved in this system are advantageous or deleterious for emerging features of the system like a fitness correlate, cycle length and cycle amplitude. We find that the DME can depend on the wild type reference used in its construction. Analyzing many models with our new approach will open up a third source of information about the distribution of mutational effects, one of the fundamental quantities that shape life.","2008","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","156-175","","","5307","","Lect N Bioinformat","","","","","","","","English","","","","ISI:000260924200011","","","","","","","drosophila; models; networks; neurospora; rhythms; robustness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bio-PEPA is a high-level language for modelling biological systems such as metabolic pathways and other biochemical reaction networks. Through providing tools for this modelling language we hope to allow easier use of a range of simulators and model-checkers thereby freeing the modeller from the responsibility of developing a custom simulator for the problem of interest. Further, by providing mappings to a range of different analysis tools the Bio-PEPA language allows modellers to compare analysis results which have been computed using independent numerical analysers, which enhances the reliability and robustness of the results computed.","2009","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","972-983","","","","","Wint Simul C Proc","","","","","","","","English","","","","ISI:000289492500092","","","","","","","exact stochastic simulation; receptors; suite; systems biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the circadian clock of Arabidopsis thaliana is modelled by fitting dynamic Bayesian networks to luminescence data gathered from experiments. This work differs from previous modelling attempts by using higher-order dynamic Bayesian networks to explicitly model the time lag between the various genes being expressed. In order to achieve this goal, new techniques in preprocessing the data and in evaluating a learned model are proposed. It is shown that it is possible, to some extent, to model these time delays using a higher-order dynamic Bayesian network.","2009","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","67-78","","","5780","","Lect N Bioinformat","","","","","","","","English","","","","ISI:000272058200007","","","","","","","arabidopsis thaliana; dynamic bayesian network; gene expression; gene regulatory network; gene-regulatory networks; knowledge; microarray data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of their experimental tractability and biological significance, circadian clocks have been the subject of a number of computational modelling studies. In this study we focus on the simple circadian clock of the fungus Neurospora crassa. We use the Bio-PEPA process algebra to develop both a stochastic and a deterministic model of the system. The light on/off mechanism responsible for entrainment to the day/night cycle is expressed using discrete time-dependent events in Bio-PEPA. In order to validate our model, we compare it against the results of previous work which demonstrated that the deterministic model is in agreement with experimental data. Here we investigate the effect of stochasticity on the robustness of the clock's function in biological timing. In particular, we focus on the variations in the phase and amplitude of oscillations in circadian proteins with respect to different factors such as the presence/absence of a positive feedback loop, and the presence/absence of light. The time-dependent sensitivity of the model with respect to some key kinetic parameters is also investigated.","2009","2025-01-31 15:33:02","2025-01-31 15:33:02","","52-67","","","5688","","Lect N Bioinformat","","","","","","","","English","","","","ISI:000276319600004","","","","","","","systems; simulation; drosophila; rhythms; frq; protein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
