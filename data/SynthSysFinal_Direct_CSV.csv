While there has been a growth of research on health and the Syrian conflict, most such research covers Syrian refugees. There is limited information about the scope and focus of research on health and population inside Syria. While there are several systemtic and scoping literarure reviews of health of Syrian refugees, there has not been a sccoping review of research literature on health issues inside Syria.             Methods             . As part of a broader scoping review covering January 2011 to December 2019, we examined English-language conflict-related research papers that studied health issues inside Syria and focused on Syrians or those permanently resident in Syria. We classified research articles based on the major thematic areas studied. We abstracted bibliometric information, study characteristics, funding statements and reported key limitations and challenges of conducting research. To gain additional insights or data, we examined separately publications reporting field and operational activities as well as personal reflections and narrative accounts of first-hand experiences inside Syria.             Results             . Of 2,088 papers identified in the scoping review, 708 (34%) exclusively focus on health issues of Syrians inside Syria, of which 350 (49%) are conflict-related with. Of conflict-related publications, 89 (25%) are research papers.  Annual volume of research increased over time, from one publication in 2013 to 27 publications in each of 2018 and 2019. Damascus is the most frequently studied governorate (n=33), followed by Aleppo (n=25). Papers used a wide range of research methodologies, primarily quantitative (n=68). The country of institutional affiliation(s) of first and last authors are Syria (n=30, 20 respectively), the United States (n=25, 19 respectively) or the United Kingdom (n=12, 10 respectively). Themes most covered were health status, health system and humanitarian assistance, response or needs (n=38, 32, 26 respectively). Thirty one publications presented field and operational activities and eight publications were reflections or first-hand personal accounts of experiences inside Syria. Authors encountered contextual, methodological and administrative challenges in doing research on health inside Syria.             Conclusions             . Although it is commonly stated that Syria is among the most documented of recent wars, our analysis shows that a relatively limited number of research studies focused on health or populations inside Syria have been published over the nine years of the conflict. Beyond the need to increase the volume of research, it is important to address the knowledge gaps identified in this review.","2020-10-19","2024-08-08 17:20:21","2024-08-08 17:20:21","2024-08-08 17:20:21","","","","","","","Conflict-Related Population Health Research in Syria, 2011-2019","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","In Review","","","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\FZJT74CH\Abouzeid et al. - 2020 - Conflict-Related Population Health Research in Syr.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/6826059fb226048a58162ba28a4004c408d78d15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased attention to remote research approaches from social scientists, due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions, is sparking interest on appropriate methods and tools. Drawing on several years’ experience of remotely conducting qualitative research in Syria, we discuss challenges and approaches to conducting more inclusive, participatory, and meaningful research from a distance. The logistics, ethics, and politics of conducting research remotely are symptomatic of broader challenges in relation to the decolonisation of global and humanitarian health research. Key to the success of remote approaches is the quality of the relationships researchers need to be able to develop with study participants without face-to-face interactions and with limited engagement ‘in the field’. Particularly given overdue efforts to decolonise research institutions and methods, lead researchers should have a meaningful connection with the area in which they are conducting research. This is critical both to reduce chances that it will be extractive and exploitative and additionally for the quality of interpretation.","2021-04-17","2024-08-08 17:19:25","2024-08-08 17:19:25","2024-08-08 17:19:24","28","","","15","","Confl Health","‘We need someone to deliver our voices’","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 33865454 PMCID: PMC8052531","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\5W3BZGAX\Douedari et al. - 2021 - ‘We need someone to deliver our voices’ reflectio.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8052531/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considerations on how to adequately ensure the well-being of research staff are largely neglected in contemporary ethics discourse. This systematic review aims to identify the ethical challenges that research staff across different hierarchical levels and scientific disciplines face when conducting research in LMICs. Methods We searched 13 electronic databases and handsearched publications in six selected journals as well as the reference lists of all included studies. No restrictions were applied with respect to the publication date, research design, and target population. Results 23 151 studies were retrieved, 183 of which met our inclusion criteria. We identified nine different types of ethical challenges that research staff may be exposed to during field research, including (1) role conflicts that can emerge from participants’ help requests and the high level of deprivation found in certain study settings, (2) feelings of guilt and (3) detrimental mental health impacts. Further challenges were (4) sexual harassment (5) safety risks and (6) political repression, particularly in postconflict, disaster-ridden or autocratic study contexts. Additionally, studies reported (7) inadequate working conditions and (8) power imbalances within research teams, while (9) ethics boards were found to be ill equipped to anticipate and address emerging risks, thus increasing the ethical liability of researchers. Conclusion This review revealed several complex ethical challenges that research staff may face during data collection. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 8.8 on ‘safe and secure working environments’ and to protect research staff from harm, amendments must urgently be made to current ethical standards.

Higher education institutions have always faced challenges in the process of internationalization, which have occupied scholarly attention in recent decades, but little research has been conducted on the internationalization of higher education in less developed African countries. This qualitative study aims to shed light on the challenges of internationalization of higher education in low-income countries in East Africa. After reviewing the literature and interviewing academics, the obtained data were thematically analyzed. The results suggested 12 main challenges, which were classified into four major categories. The challenges include a lack of clear policies and guidelines; the inefficiency of the organizational structure of internationalization; financial, infrastructure, and equipment problems; weaknesses in scientific, skill, and language competences; cultural differences; non-reciprocal relationships; and a brain drain. Finally, strategies for responding to these challenges with regard to the internal and external environments of higher education institutions were proposed. Among the internal strategies of higher education institutions are the development of clear policies and visions, planning for the development of human resources, and sustainable budgeting for internationalization programs. External strategies emphasize the development of national policies and laws based on contextual and environmental conditions, as well as interaction and participation in international meetings to expand communication and use the scientific and economic capacities of international agencies and institutions.","2023-01-23","2024-08-08 17:17:43","2024-08-08 17:17:43","2024-08-08 17:17:43","1-21","","","","","High Educ (Dordr)","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 36713135 PMCID: PMC9869809","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\CG7X5H4Q\Moshtari and Safarpour - 2023 - Challenges and strategies for the internationaliza.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9869809/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How the single-nephron GFR relates to demographic and clinical characteristics and kidney-biopsy findings in humans is unknown. METHODS: We identified 1388 living kidney donors at the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic who underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the kidney with the use of contrast material and an iothalamate-based measurement of the GFR during donor evaluation and who underwent a kidney biopsy at donation. The mean single-nephron GFR was calculated as the GFR divided by the number of nephrons (calculated as the cortical volume of both kidneys as assessed on CT times the biopsy-determined glomerular density). Demographic and clinical characteristics and biopsy findings were correlated with the single-nephron GFR. RESULTS: A total of 58% of the donors were women, and the mean (±SD) age of the donors was 44±12 years. The mean GFR was 115±24 ml per minute, the mean number of nephrons was 860,000±370,000 per kidney, and the mean single-nephron GFR was 80±40 nl per minute. The single-nephron GFR did not vary significantly according to age (among donors <70 years of age), sex, or height (among donors ≤190 cm tall). A higher single-nephron GFR was independently associated with larger nephrons on biopsy and more glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis than would be expected for age. A higher single-nephron GFR was associated with a height of more than 190 cm, obesity, and a family history of end-stage renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy adult kidney donors, the single-nephron GFR was fairly constant with regard to age, sex, and height (if ≤190 cm). A higher single-nephron GFR was associated with certain risk factors for chronic kidney disease and certain kidney-biopsy findings.

METHODS: We examined the association between death or cardiovascular event and KCD score, age-dependent stepped eGFR criteria (eGFRstep), and eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (eGFR60) in a community-based high cardiovascular risk cohort of 3837 individuals aged ≥60 (median 70, interquartile range 65, 75) years, followed for a median of 5.6 years. RESULTS: In proportional hazards analysis, KCD score ≥ 20 years (KCD20) was associated with increased risk of death or cardiovascular event in unadjusted analysis and after adjustment for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors. Addition of KCD20, eGFRstep or eGFR60 to a cardiovascular risk factor model did not improve area under the curve for identification of individuals who experienced death or cardiovascular event in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. However, addition of KCD20 or eGFR60, but not eGFRstep, to a cardiovascular risk factor model improved net reclassification and integrated discrimination. KCD20 identified individuals who experienced death or cardiovascular event with greater sensitivity than eGFRstep for all participants, and with greater sensitivity than eGFR60 for participants aged 60-69 years, with similar sensitivities for men and women. CONCLUSIONS: In this high cardiovascular risk cohort aged ≥60 years, the KCD score provided an age-adapted measure of kidney function that may assist patient education, and KCD20 provided an age-adapted criterion of eGFR-related increased risk of death or cardiovascular event. Further studies that include the full age spectrum are required to examine the optimal KCD score cut point that identifies increased risk of death or cardiovascular event, and kidney events, associated with impaired kidney function, and whether the optimal KCD score cut point is similar for men and women.

However, it is unclear whether different levels of estimated GFR (eGFR) have the same prognostic significance in older and younger patients. The study cohort was composed of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients who were aged 18 to 100 yr and had at least one outpatient serum creatinine measurement between October 1, 2001, and September 30, 2002 (n=2583,911). Patients with ESRD were excluded. GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation using each patient's first outpatient creatinine measurement during the study period. The association of eGFR with survival was measured by age group. Twenty percent of cohort patients had an eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, ranging from 3% among 18- to 44-yr-olds to as high as 49% among 85- to 100-yr-olds. Fifty-two percent (n=266,421) of cohort patients with an eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 had ""very"" moderate reductions in eGFR into the 50- to 59-ml/min per 1.73 m2 range. The association of eGFR with mortality was weaker in the elderly than in younger age groups: Whereas severe reductions in eGFR were associated with an increased risk for death in all age groups, ""very"" moderate reductions in eGFR (50 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2) were associated with an increased adjusted risk for death only among patients who were younger than 65 yr. Age-related attenuation of the association of eGFR with mortality was also present among women and black patients. In the clinical setting, mortality risk stratification in elderly patients should not be based on the same eGFR cut points as for younger age groups and would benefit from finer categorization of the 30- to 59-ml/min per 1.73 m2 eGFR group.","2006-03","2024-07-25 10:09:24","2024-07-25 10:09:24","","846-853","","3","17","","J Am Soc Nephrol","Mortality risk stratification in chronic kidney disease","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16452492","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16452492","","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Female; Male; Cause of Death; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Kidney Function Tests; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few studies have included proteinuria, while the chronicity criterion is usually omitted. To explore this, we examined the prevalence of CKD stages 1-5 in Iceland based on multiple markers of kidney damage. All serum creatinine values, urine protein measurements and diagnostic codes for kidney diseases and comorbid conditions for people aged 18 years and older were obtained from electronic medical records of all healthcare institutions in Iceland in 2008-2016. CKD was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline using diagnoses indicative of a chronic kidney disease, proteinuria and/or an eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for over three months. Mean annual age-standardized prevalence of CKD stages 1-5 was calculated based on the KDIGO criteria and age-adapted eGFR thresholds from 2,120,147 creatinine values for 218,437 individuals, 306,531 proteinuria measurements for 86,364 individuals and 6973 individuals carrying a kidney disease diagnosis. Median age was 63 years (range, 18-106) and 47% were male. The mean annual age standardized CKD prevalence was 5.13% for men and 6.75% for women using the KDIGO criteria but by age-adapted eGFR cut-offs, the prevalence was 3.27% for men and 4.01% for women. Thus, our nationwide study, defining CKD in Iceland with strict adherence to the KDIGO criteria, demonstrates a lower prevalence of CKD than anticipated from most previous studies.","2020-11","2024-07-25 10:07:20","2024-07-25 10:07:20","","1286-1295","","5","98","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32622831","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622831","","Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Middle Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Female; Kidney; Male; eGFR; CKD; Creatinine; diagnosis codes; Iceland; KDIGO criteria; Prevalence; proteinuria; serum creatinine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate possible effect modification (interaction) by age of the association of eGFR and albuminuria with clinical risk, examining both relative and absolute risks. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Individual-level meta-analysis including 2,051,244 participants from 33 general population or high-risk (of vascular disease) cohorts and 13 CKD cohorts from Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North/South America, conducted in 1972-2011 with a mean follow-up time of 5.8 years (range, 0-31 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) according to eGFR and albuminuria were meta-analyzed across age categories after adjusting for sex, race, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, and smoking. Absolute risks were estimated using HRs and average incidence rates. RESULTS: Mortality (112,325 deaths) and ESRD (8411 events) risks were higher at lower eGFR and higher albuminuria in every age category. In general and high-risk cohorts, relative mortality risk for reduced eGFR decreased with increasing age; eg, adjusted HRs at an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 were 3.50 (95% CI, 2.55-4.81), 2.21 (95% CI, 2.02-2.41), 1.59 (95% CI, 1.42-1.77), and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.23-1.48) in age categories 18-54, 55-64, 65-74, and ≥75 years, respectively (P <.05 for age interaction). Absolute risk differences for the same comparisons were higher at older age (9.0 [95% CI, 6.0-12.8], 12.2 [95% CI, 10.3-14.3], 13.3 [95% CI, 9.0-18.6], and 27.2 [95% CI, 13.5-45.5] excess deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively). For increased albuminuria, reduction of relative risk with increasing age was less evident, while differences in absolute risk were higher in older age categories (7.5 [95% CI, 4.3-11.9], 12.2 [95% CI, 7.9-17.6], 22.7 [95% CI, 15.3-31.6], and 34.3 [95% CI, 19.5-52.4] excess deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively by age category, at an albumin-creatinine ratio of 300 mg/g vs 10 mg/g). In CKD cohorts, adjusted relative hazards of mortality did not decrease with age. In all cohorts, ESRD relative risks and absolute risk differences at lower eGFR or higher albuminuria were comparable across age categories. CONCLUSIONS: Both low eGFR and high albuminuria were independently associated with mortality and ESRD regardless of age across a wide range of populations. Mortality showed lower relative risk but higher absolute risk differences at older age.","2012-12-12","2024-07-25 10:04:06","2024-07-25 10:04:06","","2349-2360","","22","308","","JAMA","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23111824 PMCID: PMC3936348","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\8DS23G39\Hallan et al. - 2012 - Age and association of kidney measures with mortal.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23111824","","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Female; Kidney; Male; Adolescent; Cohort Studies; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Albuminuria; Risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis of cross-sectional diagnostic studies. SETTING & POPULATION: Published original studies and systematic reviews in any population. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Index and reference measurements conducted within 48 hours; at least 15 participants studied; GFR markers measured in plasma or urine; plasma clearance calculation algorithm verified in another study; tubular secretion of creatinine had not been blocked by medicines. INDEX TESTS: Endogenous creatinine clearance; renal or plasma clearance of chromium 51-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), iohexol, and iothalamate; and plasma clearance of inulin. REFERENCE TEST: Renal inulin clearance measured under continuous inulin infusion and urine collection. RESULTS: Mean bias <10%, median bias <5%, the proportion of errors in the index measurements that did not exceed 30% (P30) ≥80%, and P10 ≥50% were set as requirements for sufficient accuracy. Based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, the quality of evidence across studies was rated for each index method. Renal clearance of iothalamate measured GFR with sufficient accuracy (strong evidence). Renal and plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and plasma clearance of iohexol were sufficiently accurate to measure GFR (moderately strong evidence). Renal clearance of DTPA, renal clearance of iohexol, and plasma clearance of inulin had sufficient accuracy (limited evidence). Endogenous creatinine clearance was an inaccurate method (strong evidence), as was plasma clearance of DTPA (limited evidence). The evidence to determine the accuracy of plasma iothalamate clearance was insufficient. With the exception of plasma clearance of inulin, only renal clearance methods had P30 >90%. LIMITATIONS: The included studies were few and most were old and small, which may limit generalizability. Requirements for sufficient accuracy may depend on clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: At least moderately strong evidence suggests that renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA or iothalamate and plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA or iohexol are sufficiently accurate methods to measure GFR.","2014-09","2024-07-25 10:02:21","2024-07-25 10:02:21","","411-424","","3","64","","Am J Kidney Dis","Measuring GFR","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24840668","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840668","","Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney Function Tests; renal function; accuracy; clearance marker; Cross-Sectional Studies; Glomerular filtration rate (GFR); glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement; Reproducibility of Results","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But it also declines with the progression of some diseases. This review calls for a more nuanced interpretation of kidney function in the geriatric population, who may have frailty and comorbidities. RECENT FINDINGS: GFR declines with healthy aging kidneys. Aging kidney changes include decreased cortical volume, senescent global glomerulosclerosis, and reduced nephron numbers. Yet normal aging is not associated with increased glomerular volume or single-nephron GFR. The prevalence of GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 in the geriatric population is high. However, the decline in GFR with normal aging may not reflect true CKD without albuminuria. Although the risk of ESKD and mortality increases in all age groups when eGFR less than 45 ml/min/m 2 , there is no significant increased relative risk of ESKD and mortality in the geriatric population when eGFR 45-59 ml/min/m 2 in the absence of albuminuria. Innovative approaches are needed to better estimate GFR and define CKD in the geriatric population. SUMMARY: The expected GFR decline in the geriatric population is consistent with normal aging kidney changes. To avoid CKD overdiagnosis and unnecessary referrals to nephrology for possible CKD, age-adapted definitions of CKD in the absence of albuminuria are needed.","2024-03-01","2024-07-25 10:00:05","2024-07-25 10:00:05","","267-271","","2","33","","Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37965904 PMCID: PMC10872478","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37965904","","Aged; Aging; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Kidney; Albuminuria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reviews","","0159-8090","","","Defining chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the subject of intense debate in the current nephrology literature. The debate concerns the threshold value of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) used to make the diagnosis of CKD. Current recommendations argue that a universal threshold of 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) should be used. This threshold has been defended by epidemiological studies showing that the risk of mortality or end-stage renal disease increases with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m(2). However, a universal threshold does not take into account the physiologic decline in GFR with ageing nor does it account for the risk of mortality and end-stage renal disease being trivial with isolated eGFR levels just below 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) in older subjects and significantly increased with eGFR levels just above 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) among younger patients. Overestimation of the CKD prevalence in the elderly (medicalisation of senescence) and underestimation of CKD (potentially from treatable primary nephrologic diseases) in younger patients is of primary concern. An age-calibrated definition of CKD has been proposed to distinguish age-related from disease-related changes in eGFR. For patients younger than 40 years, CKD is defined by eGFR below 75 mL/min/1.73m(2). For patients with ages between 40 and 65 years, CKD is defined by 60 mL/min/1.73m(2). For subjects older than 65 years without albuminuria or proteinuria, CKD is defined by eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73m(2).","2016-02","2024-07-17 12:33:44","2024-07-17 12:33:44","","17-26","","1","37","","Clin Biochem Rev","An Age-Calibrated Definition of Chronic Kidney Disease","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27057075 PMCID: PMC4810758","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27057075","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes associated with CKD as defined by a fixed vs an age-adapted eGFR threshold. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study was conducted in Alberta, Canada and used linked administrative and laboratory data from adults with incident CKD from April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2017, defined by a sustained reduction in eGFR for longer than 3 months below a fixed or an age-adapted eGFR threshold. Non-CKD controls were defined as being 65 years or older with a sustained eGFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 for longer than 3 months and normal/mild albuminuria. The follow-up ended on March 31, 2019. The data were analyzed from February to April 2020. EXPOSURES: A fixed eGFR threshold of 60 vs thresholds of 75, 60, and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for age younger than 40, 40 to 64, and 65 years or older, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Competing risks of kidney failure (kidney replacement initiation or sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for >3 months) and death without kidney failure. RESULTS: The fixed and age-adapted CKD cohorts included 127 132 (69 546 women [54.7%], 57 586 men [45.3%]) and 81 209 adults (44 582 women [54.9%], 36 627 men [45.1%]), respectively (537 vs 343 new cases per 100 000 person-years). The fixed-threshold cohort had lower risks of kidney failure (1.7% vs 3.0% at 5 years) and death (21.9% vs 25.4%) than the age-adapted cohort. A total of 53 906 adults were included in both cohorts. Of the individuals included in the fixed-threshold cohort only (n = 72 703), 54 342 (75%) were 65 years or older and had baseline eGFR of 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 with normal/mild albuminuria. The 5-year risks of kidney failure and death among these elderly people were similar to those of non-CKD controls, with a risk of kidney failure of 0.12% or less in both groups across all age categories and a risk of death at 69, 122, 279, and 935 times higher than the risk of kidney failure for 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and 80 years or older, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of adults with CKD suggests that the current criteria for CKD that use the same eGFR threshold for all ages may result in overestimation of the CKD burden in an aging population, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary interventions in many elderly people who have age-related loss of eGFR.","2021-10-01","2024-07-17 12:33:34","2024-07-17 12:33:34","","1359-1366","","10","181","","JAMA Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34459844 PMCID: PMC8406213","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34459844","","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aging; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Kidney Function Tests; Risk Assessment; Alberta; Medical Overuse; Mortality; Overdiagnosis; Prognosis; Renal Replacement Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Glomerular filtration of creatinine, however, is only one of the variables that determines its concentration in serum. Alterations in renal handling and metabolism of creatinine and methodological interferences in its measurement may have a profound impact on the serum concentration of creatinine. We review the fundamental principles of physiology, metabolism, and analytical chemistry that are necessary to correctly interpret the serum creatinine concentration. These principles are then applied to important clinical circumstances, including aging, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, drug administration, and acute and chronic renal failure.

However, race in eGFR equations is a social and not a biologic construct. METHODS: We developed new eGFR equations without race using data from two development data sets: 10 studies (8254 participants, 31.5% Black) for serum creatinine and 13 studies (5352 participants, 39.7% Black) for both serum creatinine and cystatin C. In a validation data set of 12 studies (4050 participants, 14.3% Black), we compared the accuracy of new eGFR equations to measured GFR. We projected the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and GFR stages in a sample of U.S. adults, using current and new equations. RESULTS: In the validation data set, the current creatinine equation that uses age, sex, and race overestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 5.4) and to a lesser degree in non-Blacks (median, 0.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 0.0 to 0.9). When the adjustment for Black race was omitted from the current eGFR equation, measured GFR in Blacks was underestimated (median, 7.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 5.9 to 8.8). A new equation using age and sex and omitting race underestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 1.8 to 5.5) and overestimated measured GFR in non-Blacks (median, 3.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 3.4 to 4.4). For all equations, 85% or more of the eGFRs for Blacks and non-Blacks were within 30% of measured GFR. New creatinine-cystatin C equations without race were more accurate than new creatinine equations, with smaller differences between race groups. As compared with the current creatinine equation, the new creatinine equations, but not the new creatinine-cystatin C equations, increased population estimates of CKD prevalence among Blacks and yielded similar or lower prevalence among non-Blacks.

The extent to which this is attributable to differences in source populations versus methodological differences between studies is uncertain. We used 4 population-based datasets from Canada, Denmark, and the United Kingdom to measure the annual incidence and prognosis of AKI and acute kidney disease (AKD), using a homogenous analytical approach that incorporated KDIGO creatinine-based definitions and subsets of the AKI/AKD criteria. The cohorts included 7 million adults ≥18 years of age between 2011 and 2014; median age 59-68 years, 51.9-54.4% female sex. Age- and sex-standardised incidence rates for AKI or AKD were similar between regions and years; range 134.3-162.4 events/10,000 person years. Among patients who met either KDIGO 48-hour or 7-day AKI creatinine criteria, the standardised 1-year mortality was similar (30.4%-38.5%) across the cohorts, which was comparable to standardised 1-year mortality among patients who met AKI/AKD criteria using a baseline creatinine within 8-90 days prior (32.0%-37.4%). Standardised 1-year mortality was lower (21.0%-25.5% across cohorts) among patients with AKI/AKD ascertained using a baseline creatinine >90 days prior. These findings illustrate that the incidence and prognosis of AKI and AKD based on KDIGO criteria are consistent across 3 high-income countries when capture of laboratory tests is complete, creatinine-based definitions are implemented consistently within but not beyond a 90-day period, and adjustment is made for population age and sex. These approaches should be consistently applied to improve the generalizability and comparability of AKI research and clinical reporting.","2022-06","2024-07-17 12:24:53","2024-07-17 12:24:53","","1271-1281","","6","101","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35398477","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\5YRF934A\Sawhney et al. - 2022 - Harmonization of epidemiology of acute kidney inju.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35398477","","Adult; Humans; Female; Male; Creatinine; Acute Kidney Injury; Prognosis; Acute Disease; acute kidney injury; chronic kidney disease; epidemiology; Incidence; Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basis for this argument is that it avoids duplication of infrastructure, information governance, privacy risks, monopolies and will promote innovation, particularly with commercial partners. However, the work around establishing TREs in the UK largely ignores the long-established local TRE landscape in Scotland, and the way in which local TREs can actually improve data quality, solve technical architecture challenges, promote information governance and risk minimisation, and encourage innovation and collaboration (both academic and commercial). This data centre profile focuses on the Grampian Data Safe Haven (DaSH), a secure, virtual healthcare data analysis and storage centre located in Aberdeen, Scotland. DaSH was co-established by the NHS Grampian Health Board and University of Aberdeen to allow for the secure processing and linking of health data for the Grampian and Scottish population when it is not practicable to obtain consent from individual patients. As an established trusted research environment now in its 10th operating year, DaSH technology ensures healthcare, social care data and other types of sensitive data, routinely collected and used without individual patient consent, are made accessible for both academic research and clinical service evaluation and improvements whilst protecting individuals' privacy at the local, national and international levels. DaSH has registered almost 600 projects and facilitated over 200 distinct research projects with data hosting, extraction, and novel linkages to completion. Ongoing innovation and collaboration between DaSH and the NHS Grampian Health Board continues to expand researcher access to new types of data and data linkages, introduce new technologies for advanced statistical research methods, and supports interdisciplinary research using population health and social care data for research, clinical and commercial advancements, and real-world practitioner applications. The purpose of this paper is to present DaSH's data population, operating model, architecture and information technology, governance, legislation and management, privacy-by-design principles and data access, data linkage methods, data sources, noteworthy research outputs, and further developments in order to demonstrate the value of local TREs within the data management and access debate.","2019","2024-07-17 12:23:43","2024-07-17 12:23:43","","1817","","2","4","","Int J Popul Data Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37671386 PMCID: PMC10476148","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\69IUBN7J\O'Sullivan and Wilde - 2019 - A profile of the Grampian Data Safe Haven, a regio.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37671386","","data centre; data extraction; data linkage; health informatics; population data; safe haven; Trusted Research Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A mixed methods approach including a literature review, interviews, focus groups and a three-round Delphi survey with HCPs in Scotland was followed by a triangulation process using a systematic protocol. The survey was structured using the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change. Items retained after applying the matrix-based triangulation process were thematically coded. Ethical approval was granted by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Service. RESULTS: Results from 18 papers, 23 interviewees, 23 participants of focus groups and 61 completed questionnaires in the Delphi survey contributed to the triangulation process. A total of 25 key findings from all four studies were identified during triangulation. There was good convergence; 21 key findings were agreed and remained to inform recommendations. The items were coded as practical/technical (eg, decision about the unique patient identifier to use), mandatory (eg, governed by statute), essential (consistently mentioned in all studies and therefore needed to ensure professional support) or preferable. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a paediatric linked database has support from professional stakeholders and HCPs in Scotland. The triangulation identified three sets of core requirements for a new system of data linkage. An additional fourth set of 'preferable' requirements might increase engagement of HCPs and their support for the new system.","2016-10-21","2024-07-17 12:22:56","2024-07-17 12:22:56","","e011879","","10","6","","BMJ Open","Core requirements for successful data linkage","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27797999 PMCID: PMC5093676","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\D6T3Z6U3\Hopf et al. - 2016 - Core requirements for successful data linkage an .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27797999","","Humans; Child; data linkage; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Attitude; Attitude of Health Personnel; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Focus Groups; Health Personnel; Information Storage and Retrieval; mixed methods research; Pediatrics; Pharmacovigilance; Scotland; State Medicine; Surveys and Questionnaires; triangulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This threshold has important caveats because it does not separate kidney disease from kidney aging, and therefore does not hold for all ages. In an extensive review of the literature, we found that GFR declines with healthy aging without any overt signs of compensation (such as elevated single-nephron GFR) or kidney damage. Older living kidney donors, who are carefully selected based on good health, have a lower predonation GFR compared with younger donors. Furthermore, the results from the large meta-analyses conducted by the CKD Prognosis Consortium and from numerous other studies indicate that the GFR threshold above which the risk of mortality is increased is not consistent across all ages. Among younger persons, mortality is increased at GFR <75 ml/min per 1.73 m2, whereas in elderly people it is increased at levels <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Therefore, we suggest that amending the CKD definition to include age-specific thresholds for GFR. The implications of an updated definition are far reaching. Having fewer healthy elderly individuals diagnosed with CKD could help reduce inappropriate care and its associated adverse effects. Global prevalence estimates for CKD would be substantially reduced. Also, using an age-specific threshold for younger persons might lead to earlier identification of CKD onset for such individuals, at a point when progressive kidney damage may still be preventable.","2019-10","2024-07-17 09:34:21","2024-07-17 09:34:21","2024-07-17 09:34:21","1785-1805","","10","30","","J Am Soc Nephrol","CKD","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 31506289 PMCID: PMC6779354","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\P3SFQDUI\Delanaye et al. - 2019 - CKD A Call for an Age-Adapted Definition.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6779354/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But it also declines with the progression of some diseases. This review calls for a more nuanced interpretation of kidney function in the geriatric population, who may have frailty and comorbidities. RECENT FINDINGS: GFR declines with healthy aging kidneys. Aging kidney changes include decreased cortical volume, senescent global glomerulosclerosis, and reduced nephron numbers. Yet normal aging is not associated with increased glomerular volume or single-nephron GFR. The prevalence of GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 in the geriatric population is high. However, the decline in GFR with normal aging may not reflect true CKD without albuminuria. Although the risk of ESKD and mortality increases in all age groups when eGFR less than 45 ml/min/m 2 , there is no significant increased relative risk of ESKD and mortality in the geriatric population when eGFR 45-59 ml/min/m 2 in the absence of albuminuria. Innovative approaches are needed to better estimate GFR and define CKD in the geriatric population. SUMMARY: The expected GFR decline in the geriatric population is consistent with normal aging kidney changes. To avoid CKD overdiagnosis and unnecessary referrals to nephrology for possible CKD, age-adapted definitions of CKD in the absence of albuminuria are needed.","2024-03-01","2024-07-17 09:33:44","2024-07-17 09:33:44","","267-271","","2","33","","Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37965904 PMCID: PMC10872478","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37965904","","Aged; Aging; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Kidney; Albuminuria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UCYKXMGK","journalArticle","2009","Glassock, Richard J.; Winearls, Christopher","Ageing and the glomerular filtration rate: truths and consequences","Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association","","0065-7778","","","The process of glomerular filtration of plasma fluid has been known for over 160 years and the measurement of the rate of its formation (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) has been possible for over 80 years. Studies conducted in the 1930's to the 1950's clearly established that GFR declines, perhaps inexorably, with normal ageing, usually beginning after 30-40 years of age. The rate of decline may accelerate after age 50-60 years. This decline appears to be a part of the normal physiologic process of cellular and organ senescence and is associated with structural changes in the kidneys. In the last decade a new paradigm has been introduced in which the true or measured GFR is estimated (eGFR) by formulas based on serum creatinine levels and in which these estimates are applied to the diagnoses of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population. These criteria for diagnosis of CKD include an absolute threshold for eGFR, unadjusted for the effects of age on the normal values for eGFR. A consequence of these criteria has been to overstate the frequency of CKD in the general population and to generate many ""false positive"" diagnoses of CKD. This paper discusses the known effects of ageing on GFR and the consequences of using a classification system for defining CKD that does not take into account the normal decline of GFR with ageing.","2009","2024-07-17 09:31:46","2024-07-17 09:31:46","","419-428","","","120","","Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc","Ageing and the glomerular filtration rate","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 19768194 PMCID: PMC2744545","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19768194","","Adult; Aged; Aging; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; False Positive Reactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we examined the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and all-cause mortality and mortality caused by cardiovascular (CV) disease and non-CV disease in the general population. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the period 1997 to 1998, all inhabitants of the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, aged between 28 and 75 years (n=85 421) were sent a postal questionnaire collecting information about risk factors for CV disease and CV morbidity and a vial to collect an early morning urine sample for measurement of urinary albumin concentration (UAC). The vital status of the cohort was subsequently obtained from the municipal register, and the cause of death was obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Of these 85 421 subjects, 40 856 (47.8%) responded, and 40 548 could be included in the analysis. During a median follow-up period of 961 days (maximum 1139 days), 516 deaths with known cause were recorded. We found a positive dose-response relationship between increasing UAC and mortality. A higher UAC increased the risk of both CV and non-CV death after adjustment for other well-recognized CV risk factors, with the increase being significantly higher for CV mortality than for non-CV mortality (P=0.014). A 2-fold increase in UAC was associated with a relative risk of 1.29 for CV mortality (95% CI 1.18 to 1.40) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.21) for non-CV mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary albumin excretion is a predictor of all-cause mortality in the general population. The excess risk was more attributable to death from CV causes, independent of the effects of other CV risk factors, and the relationship was already apparent at levels of albuminuria currently considered to be normal.","2002-10-01","2024-07-17 09:31:18","2024-07-17 09:31:18","","1777-1782","","14","106","","Circulation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 12356629","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12356629","","Adult; Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Cohort Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; Albuminuria; Mortality; Incidence; Comorbidity; Demography; Follow-Up Studies; Netherlands; Odds Ratio; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to evaluate the association between preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing and postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery. METHODS: This international cohort study included adult patients undergoing elective surgery for cancer in areas affected by SARS-CoV-2 up to 19 April 2020. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection before operation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at 30 days after surgery. Preoperative testing strategies were adjusted for confounding using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of 8784 patients (432 hospitals, 53 countries), 2303 patients (26.2 per cent) underwent preoperative testing: 1458 (16.6 per cent) had a swab test, 521 (5.9 per cent) CT only, and 324 (3.7 per cent) swab and CT. Pulmonary complications occurred in 3.9 per cent, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 2.6 per cent. After risk adjustment, having at least one negative preoperative nasopharyngeal swab test (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98; P = 0.040) was associated with a lower rate of pulmonary complications. Swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in areas with a high 14-day SARS-CoV-2 case notification rate, but not before minor surgery or in low-risk areas. To prevent one pulmonary complication, the number needed to swab test before major or minor surgery was 18 and 48 respectively in high-risk areas, and 73 and 387 in low-risk areas. CONCLUSION: Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 risk areas. There was no proven benefit of swab testing before minor surgery in low-risk areas.","2021-01-27","2024-10-16 10:59:12","2024-10-16 10:59:12","","88-96","","1","108","","Br J Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33640908 PMCID: PMC7717156","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\6U3RRZIB\COVIDSurg Collaborative - 2021 - Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing and posto.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33640908","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Risk Assessment; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing; Elective Surgical Procedures; Lung Diseases; Nasopharynx; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Postoperative Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) and its potential impact have not been established yet in infertile women seeking assisted reproduction technologies in Syria.           This study aims to determine the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and lupus anticoagulation (LAC) and their association with age and the In vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in a large sample of Syrian women.           Materials and methods:            The electronic patients’ records were screened and relevant data extraction was performed retrospectively. The study included 876 women who had IVF between January 2012 and January 2020 in a tertiary care hospital.           Results:            The prevalence of APA among the included women was less than 1%. Only 5 patients had positive APA. No correlation was found between the APA levels and age. Additionally, the APA did not have an impact on neither the IVF outcomes nor the number of IVF cycles.           Conclusion:            the added value of APS antibodies’ screening could be considered very modest when compared to its financial burden on patients since it has a very low prevalence in women having IVF.

This syndrome is caused by NOTCH2 gene mutations, which cause an increase of osteoclast and osteoblast activity that leads to the increased bone resorption. Because of how rare the syndrome is and the vague onset of the symptoms, it can be challenging to make an early diagnosis. Case presentation We report a case of a female child with HCS who has a new NOTCH2 mutation sequence; (NM_024408.3:c.6463G > T) protein change (Glu2155*), and to our knowledge this is the first reported and diagnosed case in Syria. She presents with short stature, unique craniofacial features, scoliosis, kyphosis, and signs of osteoporosis, in addition to Patent Ductus Arteriosus. The patient was diagnosed with Hajdu Cheney Syndrome, and administered zolidronic acid, and she responded well to the treatment; showing signs of improved bone density and improvement in height, where her bone density improved from 0.23 to 0.31, and she gained 11 cm in height after the treatment. Conclusion Due to the rarity of the syndrome, there is no established guideline for treatment yet. Based on the pathophysiology of the syndrome that causes increased bone resorption, treatment with the Bisphosphonates group has yielded positive outcomes. Furthermore, we compare different treatments in the literature with their results.","2021-11-01","2024-10-16 10:57:28","2024-10-16 10:57:28","","103023","","","71","","Annals of Medicine and Surgery","Hajdu Cheney syndrome; A novel NOTCH2 mutation in a Syrian child, and treatment with zolidronic acid","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\2CFYTX7S\Ahmad et al. - 2021 - Hajdu Cheney syndrome; A novel NOTCH2 mutation in .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355879613_Hajdu_Cheney_syndrome_A_novel_NOTCH2_mutation_in_a_Syrian_child_and_treatment_with_zolidronic_acid_A_case_report_and_a_literature_review_of_treatments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from most cases of failure of endodontic treatment. Therefore, using the appropriate intra-canal dressing is essential for successful treatment. The improved formula used in calcium hydroxide PLUS points ensures more calcium hydroxide is released over a longer period and more space to release calcium hydration. This in vitro research aimed to evaluate the differences in the efficacy between Ca(OH)2 paste and PLUS points as an endodontic dressing in eradicating E. faecalis growth inside infected single-rooted canals. Materials and methods: Thirty mandibular first premolars with single canals were extracted for orthodontic reasons and were prepared after cutting their crowns to standardize the length of the roots to 17 mm, root preparation, and isolating E. faecalis. The infected sample root canals were contaminated with the prepared bacterial suspension, and the sample was incubated in the incubator under air conditions at 37°C for seven days, counting the bacteria colonies. Then, the bacterial units were counted before applying the drug, applying Ca(OH)2 paste in the first group and Ca(OH)2 PLUS points in the second group. The bacterial units were counted, and the number of bacteria was compared between the two substances applied to the samples, measuring the intracanal dressings' effectiveness. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to detect significant differences. Results: The results showed a statistically significant difference in the bacterial count of E. faecalis before and after applying the dressing of Ca(OH)2 paste from a mean of 11.89 to a mean of 3.18 (p=0.003) and no statistical difference in applying Ca(OH)2 PLUS points from mean 11.98 to mean 10.50 (p>0.05). Conclusion: Within the limits of the current in vitro study, the Ca(OH)2 paste cones were more effective than Ca(OH)2 PLUS points in eradicating E. faecalis growth inside the infected single-rooted canals.","2023-05-25","2024-10-16 10:54:17","2024-10-16 10:54:17","","","","","15","","Cureus","Antimicrobial Efficacy of Two Different Calcium Hydroxide Endodontic Dressings on the Eradication of Enterococcus Faecalis in Single- Rooted Canals","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\JTNGJTHV\Rumhein et al. - 2023 - Antimicrobial Efficacy of Two Different Calcium Hy.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371013726_Antimicrobial_Efficacy_of_Two_Different_Calcium_Hydroxide_Endodontic_Dressings_on_the_Eradication_of_Enterococcus_Faecalis_in_Single-_Rooted_Canals_An_In-Vitro_Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the condition’s widespread impact, there are substantial gaps in the comprehension of its pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and therapeutic response, particularly concerning systemic disease-associated uveitis. Aim of the Study The current study aims to bridge these gaps through an extensive examination of demographic and clinical features in AU patients, thereby informing future research, and therapeutic strategies, and improving patient outcomes. Methods This retrospective observational study analyzed 261 patients with systemic disease-associated uveitis from January 2018 to December 2022 in Damascus, Syria. With diagnoses made using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group Criteria, the study evaluated tailored treatment efficacy at the 24-month post-treatment mark, alongside comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, laboratory evaluations, and radiographic assessments. Results In our study included 87 patients with Systemic Disease-Associated Autoimmune Uveitis (SDA-AU). Women represented 64.36% of this group, and the mean age at diagnosis was 39.8 ± 17.9 years (range 7–71) for men and 43.8 ±15.4 years (range 11–69). The most reported symptom was a painful red eye (52.87%). The onset of symptoms was sudden for 32.18% of patients, while 67.81% reported gradual development. Complications occurred in 33.33% of patients, including cataracts (41.37% of those with complications) and glaucoma (17.24%). Laboratory evaluations showed elevated inflammation markers in 66.66% of patients. Upon the 24-month assessment, 48.27% of patients achieved complete remission, 37.93% showed significant improvement, while disease worsened in 13.79% of cases. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that the presentation of autoimmune uveitis in this cohort frequently precedes the diagnosis of systemic diseases, affirming the vital role of an early and accurate diagnosis of uveitis for the detection of underlying systemic conditions. In conclusion, our study underlines the significance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of SD-AU, leading to improved prognosis and quality of life for patients.","2024-04-19","2024-10-16 10:53:32","2024-10-16 10:53:32","","","","","86","","Annals of Medicine & Surgery","Characterizing autoimmune uveitis to systemic diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\hdeeb\Zotero\storage\SH5ENNTI\Kudsi et al. - 2024 - Characterizing autoimmune uveitis to systemic dise.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380012562_Characterizing_autoimmune_uveitis_to_systemic_diseases_A_retrospective_study_from_a_Syrian_tertiary_reference_center","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a random effect model meta‐analysis to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) for efficacy and safety outcome variables between PT and IMRT. From 641 identified articles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 3087 patients (606 treated with PT and 2481 with IMRT). On toxicity analysis, PT is associated with decreased acute grade 1 nausea (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13–0.84, p = 0.02) compared to IMRT. In grade 2 toxicity, PT showed significant advantages over IMRT in mucositis (OR = 0.44, p < 0.0001), dysgeusia (OR = 0.35, p = 0.02), dysphagia (OR = 0.36, p < 0.0001), fatigue (OR = 0.29, p = 0.001), pain (OR = 0.34, p = 0.01), and weight loss (OR = 0.54, p = 0.02). Proton therapy also exhibited increased safety in grade 3 dysphagia incidence (OR = 0.44, p < 0.0001) compared to IMRT.

The novel model organism Ostreococcus tauri is the smallest free-living eukaryote known to date, and possesses a greatly reduced genome size and cellular complexity, manifested by the presence of just one of most organelles (mitochondrion, chloroplast, golgi stack) per cell, and a genome containing only ~8000 genes. Furthermore, the combination of unicellularity and easy culture provides a platform amenable to chemical biology approaches. Recently, Ostreococcus has been successfully employed to study basic mechanisms underlying circadian timekeeping. Results from this model organism have impacted not only plant science, but also mammalian biology. This example highlights how rapid experimentation in a simple eukaryote from the green lineage can accelerate research in more complex organisms by generating testable hypotheses using methods technically feasible only in this background of reduced complexity. Knowledge of a genome and the possibility to modify genes are essential tools in any model species. Genomic, Transcriptomic, and Proteomic information for this species is freely available, whereas the previously reported methods to genetically transform Ostreococcus are known to few laboratories worldwide. In this article, the experimental methods to genetically transform this novel model organism with an overexpression construct by means of electroporation are outlined in detail, as well as the method of inclusion of transformed cells in low percentage agarose to allow selection of transformed lines originating from a single transformed cell. Following the successful application of Ostreococcus to circadian research, growing interest in Ostreococcus can be expected from diverse research areas within and outside plant sciences, including biotechnological areas. Researchers from a broad range of biological and medical sciences that work on conserved biochemical pathways may consider pursuing research in Ostreococcus, free from the genomic and organismal complexity of larger model species.","2012","2025-01-16 09:57:20","2025-01-16 09:57:20","","e4074","","65","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22825291","","","Edition: 2012/07/25","","","","*Genome, Plant; *Transformation, Genetic; Chlorophyta/*genetics; DNA, Plant/genetics; Electroporation/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therapies that target the 'host' biological processes in infectious diseases are often limited to the use of vaccines and biologics rather than small molecules. The development of host drug targets for small molecules is constrained by a limited knowledge of the underlying role of each target, particularly its potential to cause harmful side effects after targeting. By considering the combinatorial complexity of pathways from the outset, we can develop modeling tools that are better suited to analyzing large pathways, enabling us to identify new causal relationships. This could lead to new drug target strategies that beneficially disrupt host-pathogen interactions, minimizing the number of side effects. We introduce logic theory as part of a pathway modeling approach that can provide a new framework for understanding pathways and refine 'host-based' drug target identification strategies.","2010-02","2025-01-16 09:57:20","2025-01-16 09:57:20","","163-76","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20143942","","","Edition: 2010/02/11","","","","*Gene Expression Regulation; *Host-Pathogen Interactions; *Infection; *Signal Transduction; Humans; Systems Biology/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its genome consists of two chromosomes and a 80 kb plasmid. Although it can grow under a wide range of pressures, P. profundum grows optimally at 28 MPa and 15 degrees C. Its ability to grow at atmospheric pressure allows for both easy genetic manipulation and culture, making it a model organism to study piezophily. Here, we report a shotgun proteomic analysis of P. profundum grown at atmospheric compared to high pressure using label-free quantitation and mass spectrometry analysis. We have identified differentially expressed proteins involved in high pressure adaptation, which have been previously reported using other methods. Proteins involved in key metabolic pathways were also identified as being differentially expressed. Proteins involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were up-regulated at high pressure. Conversely, several proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway were up-regulated at atmospheric pressure. Some of the proteins that were differentially identified are regulated directly in response to the physical impact of pressure. The expression of some proteins involved in nutrient transport or assimilation, are likely to be directly regulated by pressure. In a natural environment, different hydrostatic pressures represent distinct ecosystems with their own particular nutrient limitations and abundances. However, the only variable considered in this study was atmospheric pressure.","2013","2025-01-16 09:57:20","2025-01-16 09:57:20","","e60897","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","23741291","","","Edition: 2013/06/07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly nonlinear kinetics and multiple loops are often incorporated into models to match experimental time-series data, but these also impact on model properties for clock models. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we study the consequences of complicated structure and nonlinearity using simple Goodwin-type oscillators and the complex Arabidopsis circadian clock models. Sensitivity analysis of the simple oscillators implies that an interlocked multi-loop structure reinforces sensitivity/robustness properties, enhancing the response to external and internal variations. Furthermore, we found that reducing the degree of nonlinearity could sometimes enhance the robustness of models, implying that ad hoc incorporation of nonlinearity could be detrimental to a model's perceived credibility. CONCLUSION: The correct multi-loop structure and degree of nonlinearity are therefore critical in contributing to the desired properties of a model as well as its capacity to match experimental data.","2010","2025-01-16 09:57:20","2025-01-16 09:57:20","","e13867","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21152419","","","Edition: 2010/12/15","","","","*Models, Biological; Algorithms; Arabidopsis/*physiology; Circadian Clocks/*physiology; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; Ecosystem; Feedback, Physiological/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This processing is commonly modelled by permitting mRNA to be transcribed only when the promoter is in the on state. In this simple on/off model, the many processes involved in active transcription are represented by a single reaction. These processes include elongation, which has a minimum time for completion and processing that is not captured in the model. METHODOLOGY: In this paper, we explore the impact on the mRNA distribution of representing the elongation process in more detail. Consideration of the mechanisms of elongation leads to two alternative models of the coupling between the elongating polymerase and the state of the promoter: Processivity allows polymerases to complete elongation irrespective of the promoter state, whereas coupling requires the promoter to be active to produce a full-length transcript. We demonstrate that these alternatives have a significant impact on the predicted distributions. Models are simulated by the Gillespie algorithm, and the third and fourth moments of the resulting distribution are computed in order to characterise the length of the tail, and sharpness of the peak. By this methodology, we show that the moments provide a concise summary of the distribution, showing statistically-significant differences across much of the feasible parameter range. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that processivity is not fully consistent with the on/off model unless the probability of successfully completing elongation is low--as has been observed. The results also suggest that some form of coupling between the promoter and a rate-limiting step in transcription may explain the cell's inability to maintain high mRNA levels at low noise--a prediction of the on/off model that has no supporting evidence.","2010","2025-01-16 09:57:20","2025-01-16 09:57:20","","e8845","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20126621","","","Edition: 2010/02/04","","","","*Transcription, Genetic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Messenger/*genetics; Stochastic Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report an intimate link between the innate immune response to infection and regulation of the sterol metabolic network characterized by down-regulation of sterol biosynthesis by an interferon regulatory loop mechanism. In time-series experiments profiling genome-wide lipid-associated gene expression of macrophages, we show a selective and coordinated negative regulation of the complete sterol pathway upon viral infection or cytokine treatment with IFNgamma or beta but not TNF, IL1beta, or IL6. Quantitative analysis at the protein level of selected sterol metabolic enzymes upon infection shows a similar level of suppression. Experimental testing of sterol metabolite levels using lipidomic-based measurements shows a reduction in metabolic output. On the basis of pharmacologic and RNAi inhibition of the sterol pathway we show augmented protection against viral infection, and in combination with metabolite rescue experiments, we identify the requirement of the mevalonate-isoprenoid branch of the sterol metabolic network in the protective response upon statin or IFNbeta treatment. Conditioned media experiments from infected cells support an involvement of secreted type 1 interferon(s) to be sufficient for reducing the sterol pathway upon infection. Moreover, we show that infection of primary macrophages containing a genetic knockout of the major type I interferon, IFNbeta, leads to only a partial suppression of the sterol pathway, while genetic knockout of the receptor for all type I interferon family members, ifnar1, or associated signaling component, tyk2, completely abolishes the reduction of the sterol biosynthetic activity upon infection. Levels of the proteolytically cleaved nuclear forms of SREBP2, a key transcriptional regulator of sterol biosynthesis, are reduced upon infection and IFNbeta treatment at both the protein and de novo transcription level. The reduction in srebf2 gene transcription upon infection and IFN treatment is also found to be strictly dependent on ifnar1. Altogether these results show that type 1 IFN signaling is both necessary and sufficient for reducing the sterol metabolic network activity upon infection, thereby linking the regulation of the sterol pathway with interferon anti-viral defense responses. These findings bring a new link between sterol metabolism and interferon antiviral response and support the idea of using host metabolic modifiers of innate immunity as a potential antiviral strategy.","2011-03","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","e1000598","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21408089","","","Edition: 2011/03/17","","","","*Down-Regulation; Animals; Antiviral Agents/pharmacology; Cholesterol/metabolism; Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology/metabolism; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology; Immunity, Innate; Interferon-beta/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology; Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology; Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/virology; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muromegalovirus/*immunology; NIH 3T3 Cells; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction; Simvastatin/pharmacology; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2/physiology; Sterols/*biosynthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it was reported that newly transcribed RNA can be biosynthetically labeled for 1-2 h using thiolated nucleosides, purified from total cellular RNA and subjected to microarray analysis. However, in order to study signaling events at molecular level, analysis of changes occurring within minutes is required. We developed an improved approach to separate total cellular RNA into newly transcribed and preexisting RNA following 10-15 min of metabolic labeling. Employing new computational tools for array normalization and half-life determination we simultaneously study short-term RNA synthesis and decay as well as their impact on cellular transcript levels. As an example we studied the response of fibroblasts to type I and II interferons (IFN). Analysis of RNA transcribed within 15-30 min at different times during the first three hours of interferon-receptor activation resulted in a >10-fold increase in microarray sensitivity and provided a comprehensive profile of the kinetics of IFN-mediated changes in gene expression. We identify a previously undisclosed highly connected network of short-lived transcripts selectively down-regulated by IFNgamma in between 30 and 60 min after IFN treatment showing strong associations with cell cycle and apoptosis, indicating novel mechanisms by which IFNgamma affects these pathways.","2008-09","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","1959-72","","9","14","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","18658122","","","Edition: 2008/07/29","","","","*Gene Expression Regulation; Animals; Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism; Gene Expression Profiling/*methods; Interferon Type I/pharmacology; Interferon-gamma/pharmacology; Mice; NIH 3T3 Cells; RNA Stability/*genetics; RNA, Messenger/analysis/*biosynthesis; Transcription, Genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, cell-type specific and patient-to-patient variability in response to SERMs (from suppression to stimulation of cancer growth), as well as frequent emergence of drug resistance, represents a serious problem. The molecular processes behind mixed effects of SERMs remain poorly understood, and this strongly motivates application of systems approaches. In this work, we aimed to establish a mathematical model of ER-dependent gene expression to explore potential mechanisms underlying the variable actions of SERMs. RESULTS: We developed an equilibrium model of ER binding with 17beta-estradiol, tamoxifen and DNA, and linked it to a simple ODE model of ER-induced gene expression. The model was parameterised on the broad range of literature available experimental data, and provided a plausible mechanistic explanation for the dual agonism/antagonism action of tamoxifen in the reference cell line used for model calibration. To extend our conclusions to other cell types we ran global sensitivity analysis and explored model behaviour in the wide range of biologically plausible parameter values, including those found in cancer cells. Our findings suggest that transcriptional response to tamoxifen is controlled in a complex non-linear way by several key parameters, including ER expression level, hormone concentration, amount of ER-responsive genes and the capacity of ER-tamoxifen complexes to stimulate transcription (e.g. by recruiting co-regulators of transcription). The model revealed non-monotonic dependence of ER-induced transcriptional response on the expression level of ER, that was confirmed experimentally in four variants of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. CONCLUSIONS: We established a minimal mechanistic model of ER-dependent gene expression, that predicts complex non-linear effects in transcriptional response to tamoxifen in the broad range of biologically plausible parameter values. Our findings suggest that the outcome of a SERM's action is defined by several key components of cellular micro-environment, that may contribute to cell-type-specific effects of SERMs and justify the need for the development of combinatorial biomarkers for more accurate prediction of the efficacy of SERMs in specific cell types.","2012","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","138","","","6","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","23134774","","","Edition: 2012/11/09","","","","*Models, Biological; *Nonlinear Dynamics; Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism; Estrogens/genetics/*metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Response Elements/drug effects; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*pharmacology; Tamoxifen/*pharmacology; Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects; Transcriptome/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recently published Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) proposes a minimal set of information that should be provided to allow the reproduction of simulation experiments among users and software tools. RESULTS: In this article, we present the Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML). SED-ML encodes in a computer-readable exchange format the information required by MIASE to enable reproduction of simulation experiments. It has been developed as a community project and it is defined in a detailed technical specification and additionally provides an XML schema. The version of SED-ML described in this publication is Level 1 Version 1. It covers the description of the most frequent type of simulation experiments in the area, namely time course simulations. SED-ML documents specify which models to use in an experiment, modifications to apply on the models before using them, which simulation procedures to run on each model, what analysis results to output, and how the results should be presented. These descriptions are independent of the underlying model implementation. SED-ML is a software-independent format for encoding the description of simulation experiments; it is not specific to particular simulation tools. Here, we demonstrate that with the growing software support for SED-ML we can effectively exchange executable simulation descriptions. CONCLUSIONS: With SED-ML, software can exchange simulation experiment descriptions, enabling the validation and reuse of simulation experiments in different tools. Authors of papers reporting simulation experiments can make their simulation protocols available for other scientists to reproduce the results. Because SED-ML is agnostic about exact modeling language(s) used, experiments covering models from different fields of research can be accurately described and combined.","2011","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","198","","","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22172142","","","Edition: 2011/12/17","","","","*Computer Simulation; *Programming Languages; *Software; Computational Biology/*methods; Reproducibility of Results","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key challenge is to identify the structures in biological circuits that confer system-level properties such as robustness. Circadian clocks allow organisms to adapt to the predictable changes of the 24-hour day/night cycle by generating endogenous rhythms that can be entrained to the external cycle. In all organisms, the clock circuits typically comprise multiple interlocked feedback loops controlling the rhythmic expression of key genes. Previously, we showed that such architectures increase the flexibility of the clock's rhythmic behaviour. We now test the relationship between flexibility and robustness, using a mathematical model of the circuit controlling conidiation in the fungus Neurospora crassa. RESULTS: The circuit modelled in this work consists of a central negative feedback loop, in which the frequency (frq) gene inhibits its transcriptional activator white collar-1 (wc-1), interlocked with a positive feedback loop in which FRQ protein upregulates WC-1 production. Importantly, our model reproduces the observed entrainment of this circuit under light/dark cycles with varying photoperiod and cycle duration. Our simulations show that whilst the level of frq mRNA is driven directly by the light input, the falling phase of FRQ protein, a molecular correlate of conidiation, maintains a constant phase that is uncoupled from the times of dawn and dusk. The model predicts the behaviour of mutants that uncouple WC-1 production from FRQ's positive feedback, and shows that the positive loop enhances the buffering of conidiation phase against seasonal photoperiod changes. This property is quantified using Kitano's measure for the overall robustness of a regulated system output. Further analysis demonstrates that this functional robustness is a consequence of the greater evolutionary flexibility conferred on the circuit by the interlocking loop structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that the behaviour of the fungal clock in light-dark cycles can be accounted for by a transcription-translation feedback model of the central FRQ-WC oscillator. More generally, we provide an example of a biological circuit in which greater flexibility yields improved robustness, while also introducing novel sensitivity analysis techniques applicable to a broader range of cellular oscillators.","2010","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","88","","","4","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20576110","","","Edition: 2010/06/26","","","","*Models, Biological; Biological Clocks/*physiology; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; Computer Simulation; Feedback, Physiological/physiology; Fungal Proteins/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology; Homeostasis/*physiology; Neurospora crassa/*physiology; Photoperiod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Manual curation of the published literature was carried out in order to define the components of these pathways and the interactions between them. This information has been assembled into a large integrated directional network and represented graphically using the modified Edinburgh Pathway Notation (mEPN) scheme. RESULTS: The diagram includes detailed views of the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, other pathogen recognition systems, NF-kappa-B, apoptosis, interferon signalling, MAP-kinase cascades, MHC antigen presentation and proteasome assembly, as well as selected views of the transcriptional networks they regulate. The integrated pathway includes a total of 496 unique proteins, the complexes formed between them and the processes in which they are involved. This produces a network of 2,170 nodes connected by 2,553 edges. CONCLUSIONS: The pathway diagram is a navigable visual aid for displaying a consensus view of the pathway information available for these systems. It is also a valuable resource for computational modelling and aid in the interpretation of functional genomics data. We envisage that this work will be of value to those interested in macrophage biology and also contribute to the ongoing Systems Biology community effort to develop a standard notation scheme for the graphical representation of biological pathways.","2010","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","63","","","4","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20470404","","","Edition: 2010/05/18","","","","*Audiovisual Aids; Gene Regulatory Networks/*immunology; Interferons/metabolism; Macrophage Activation/*immunology; MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology; NF-kappa B/metabolism; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism; Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods; Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current systems biology has accumulated much data on mutations with large effects and can predict the properties of knockout mutants in some systems. However experimental methods are too insensitive to observe small effects. RESULTS: Here I propose a novel framework that brings together evolutionary theory and current systems biology approaches in order to quantify small effects of mutations and their epistatic interactions in silico. Central to this approach is the definition of fitness correlates that can be computed in some current systems biology models employing the rigorous algorithms that are at the core of much work in computational systems biology. The framework exploits synergies between the realism of such models and the need to understand real systems in evolutionary theory. This framework can address many longstanding topics in evolutionary biology by defining various 'levels' of the adaptive landscape. Addressed topics include the distribution of mutational effects on fitness, as well as the nature of advantageous mutations, epistasis and robustness. Combining corresponding parameter estimates with population genetics models raises the possibility of testing evolutionary hypotheses at a new level of realism. CONCLUSION: EvoSysBio is expected to lead to a more detailed understanding of the fundamental principles of life by combining knowledge about well-known biological systems from several disciplines. This will benefit both evolutionary theory and current systems biology. Understanding robustness by analysing distributions of mutational effects and epistasis is pivotal for drug design, cancer research, responsible genetic engineering in synthetic biology and many other practical applications.","2009","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","27","","","3","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19239699","","","Edition: 2009/02/26","","","","*Algorithms; *Biological Evolution; *Models, Genetic; Adaptation, Biological/*genetics; Genetics, Population; Genomics/*methods; Mutation/genetics; Systems Biology/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular regulation of this response has been studied in great detail but comprehensive and unambiguous diagrams describing these events are generally unavailable. Four key signalling cascades triggered early-on in the innate immune response are the toll-like receptor, interferon, NF-kappaB and apoptotic pathways, which co-operate to defend cells against a given pathogen. However, these pathways are commonly viewed as separate entities rather than an integrated network of molecular interactions. RESULTS: Here we describe the construction of a logically represented pathway diagram which attempts to integrate these four pathways central to innate immunity using a modified version of the Edinburgh Pathway Notation. The pathway map is available in a number of electronic formats and editing is supported by yEd graph editor software. CONCLUSION: The map presents a powerful visual aid for interpreting the available pathway interaction knowledge and underscores the valuable contribution well constructed pathway diagrams make to communicating large amounts of molecular interaction data.

Therefore we have established a high throughput method of RNA extraction from Arabidopsis thaliana to facilitate gene expression studies in this widely used plant model. We present optimised manual and automated protocols for the extraction of total RNA from 9-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings in a 96 well plate format using silica membrane-based methodology. Consistent and reproducible yields of high quality RNA are isolated averaging 8.9 mug total RNA per sample (~20 mg plant tissue). The purified RNA is suitable for subsequent qPCR analysis of the expression of over 500 genes in triplicate from each sample. Using the automated procedure, 192 samples (2 x 96 well plates) can easily be fully processed (samples homogenised, RNA purified and quantified) in less than half a day. Additionally we demonstrate that plant samples can be stored in RNAlater at -20 degrees C (but not 4 degrees C) for 10 months prior to extraction with no significant effect on RNA yield or quality. Additionally, disrupted samples can be stored in the lysis buffer at -20 degrees C for at least 6 months prior to completion of the extraction procedure providing a flexible sampling and storage scheme to facilitate complex time series experiments.","2011","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","40","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22136293","","","Edition: 2011/12/06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we have used targeted RNA interference to suppress the expression of a number of key genes associated with IFN signalling in murine macrophages prior to stimulation with interferon-gamma. Genome-wide changes in transcript abundance caused by siRNA activity were measured using exon-level microarrays in the presence or absence of IFNgamma. RESULTS: Transfection of murine bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) with a non-targeting (control) siRNA and 11 sequence-specific siRNAs was performed using a cationic lipid transfection reagent (Lipofectamine2000) prior to stimulation with IFNgamma. Total RNA was harvested from cells and gene expression measured on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. Network-based analysis of these data revealed six siRNAs to cause a marked shift in the macrophage transcriptome in the presence or absence IFNgamma. These six siRNAs targeted the Ifnb1, Irf3, Irf5, Stat1, Stat2 and Nfkb2 transcripts. The perturbation of the transcriptome by the six siRNAs was highly similar in each case and affected the expression of over 600 downstream transcripts. Regulated transcripts were clustered based on co-expression into five major groups corresponding to transcriptional networks associated with the type I and II IFN response, cell cycle regulation, and NF-KB signalling. In addition we have observed a significant non-specific immune stimulation of cells transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine2000, suggesting use of this reagent in BMDMs, even at low concentrations, is enough to induce a type I IFN response. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the type I IFN response in murine BMDMs is dependent on Ifnb1, Irf3, Irf5, Stat1, Stat2 and Nfkb2, and that siRNAs targeted to these genes results in perturbation of key transcriptional networks associated with type I and type II IFN signalling and a suppression of macrophage M1 polarization.","2009","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","372","","","10","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19664281","","","Edition: 2009/08/12","","","","*Gene Regulatory Networks; *RNA Interference; Animals; Binding Sites; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Profiling/*methods; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Genome-Wide Association Study/methods; Interferon-gamma/*metabolism; Macrophages/*metabolism; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Multigene Family; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism; Transcription Factors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: Here we show that proteomic analyses largely benefit from using separate treatment of peptides matching to proteins alone or in groups based on locally estimated false discovery rates. Our implementation reduces the number of false positives and simultaneously increases the number of proteins identified. Importantly, single peptide identifications achieve defined confidence and the sequence coverage of proteins is optimized. As a result, we improve the number of proteins identified in a human serum analysis by 58% without compromising identification confidence. CONCLUSION: We show that proteins can reliably be identified with a single peptide and the sequence coverage for multi-peptide proteins can be increased when using an improved estimation of false discovery rates.","2009","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","179","","","10","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19523214","","","Edition: 2009/06/16","","","","Databases, Protein; False Positive Reactions; Peptides/*analysis/*classification; Proteins/analysis; Proteomics/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis of the resulting data tests the limits of existing bioinformatics computing infrastructure. A solution to this issue is to use High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which contain many processors and more memory than desktop computer systems. Many biostatisticians use R to process the data gleaned from microarray analysis and there is even a dedicated group of packages, Bioconductor, for this purpose. However, to exploit HPC systems, R must be able to utilise the multiple processors available on these systems. There are existing modules that enable R to use multiple processors, but these are either difficult to use for the HPC novice or cannot be used to solve certain classes of problems. A method of exploiting HPC systems, using R, but without recourse to mastering parallel programming paradigms is therefore necessary to analyse genomic data to its fullest. RESULTS: We have designed and built a prototype framework that allows the addition of parallelised functions to R to enable the easy exploitation of HPC systems. The Simple Parallel R INTerface (SPRINT) is a wrapper around such parallelised functions. Their use requires very little modification to existing sequential R scripts and no expertise in parallel computing. As an example we created a function that carries out the computation of a pairwise calculated correlation matrix. This performs well with SPRINT. When executed using SPRINT on an HPC resource of eight processors this computation reduces by more than three times the time R takes to complete it on one processor. CONCLUSION: SPRINT allows the biostatistician to concentrate on the research problems rather than the computation, while still allowing exploitation of HPC systems. It is easy to use and with further development will become more useful as more functions are added to the framework.","2008","2025-01-16 09:57:21","2025-01-16 09:57:21","","558","","","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19114001","","","Edition: 2008/12/31","","","","*Computing Methodologies; *Software; Algorithms; Animals; Computational Biology/*methods; Computer Graphics; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling/methods; Genomics; Humans; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Programming Languages; User-Computer Interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors describe here a numerically continuous function suitable for use in SBML for models of circadian rhythms forced by periodic light-dark cycles.

The authors have implemented this function in SBML and demonstrated its ability to modify the behavior of publicly available models to accurately reproduce published results. The implementation of ISSF allows standard simulation software to reproduce specialized circadian protocols, such as the phase-response curve. To facilitate the reuse of this function in public models, the authors have developed software to configure its behavior without any specialist knowledge of SBML.

Systems biology approaches lend themselves to rapid in silico testing of factors, which may confer resistance to targeted therapies. Inthis study, we aimed to develop a new kinetic model that could be interrogated to predict resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor therapies and directly test predictions in vitro and in clinical samples. The new mathematical model included RTK inhibitor antibody binding, HER2/HER3 dimerization and inhibition, AKT/mitogen-activated protein kinase cross-talk, and the regulatory properties of PTEN. The model was parameterized using quantitative phosphoprotein expression data from cancer cell lines using reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative PTEN protein expression was found to be the key determinant of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in silico, which was predictive of unseen experiments in vitro using the PTEN inhibitor bp(V). When measured in cancer cell lines, PTEN expression predicts sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy; furthermore, this quantitative measurement is more predictive of response (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.5; P < 0.0001) than other pathway components taken in isolation and when tested by multivariate analysis in a cohort of 122 breast cancers treated with trastuzumab.

This developmental asymmetry arises because the expression of the HO endonuclease, which initiates the interconversion of a and alpha mating type cassettes, is extinguished by the daughter-specific Ash1 transcriptional repressor. When daughters become mothers in the subsequent cell cycle, Ash1 must be eliminated to enable a new developmental state. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Cdc4) mediates the phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1. The inactivation of SCF(Cdc4) stabilizes Ash1 in vivo, and consistently, Ash1 binds to and is ubiquitinated by SCF(Cdc4) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in vitro. The mutation of a critical in vivo cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation site (Thr290) on Ash1 reduces its ubiquitination and rate of degradation in vivo and decreases the frequency of mating type switching. Ash1 associates with active Cdc28 kinase in vivo and is targeted to SCF(Cdc4) in a Cdc28-dependent fashion in vivo and in vitro. Ash1 recognition by Cdc4 appears to be mediated by at least three phosphorylation sites that form two redundant diphosphorylated degrons. The phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system thus underpins developmental asymmetry in budding yeast.","2011-02","2025-01-16 09:57:22","2025-01-16 09:57:22","","584-98","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21098119","","","Edition: 2010/11/26","","","","*Genes, Mating Type, Fungal; *Transcription, Genetic; Amino Acid Sequence; CDC28 Protein Kinase, S cerevisiae/metabolism; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism; F-Box Proteins/*metabolism; Gene Silencing; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphorylation; Phosphothreonine/metabolism; Protein Binding; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protein Stability; Protein Transport; Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*enzymology/*genetics; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism; Ubiquitination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Type I interferon (alpha/beta interferon [IFN-alpha/beta]) and type II interferon (IFN-gamma) play a crucial role in activating macrophages and subsequently restricting viral infections. Both types of IFNs signal through related but distinct signaling pathways, inducing a vast number of interferon-stimulated genes that are overlapping but distinguishable. The exact mechanism by which IFNs, particularly IFN-gamma, inhibit DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) is still not fully understood. Here, we investigate the antiviral state developed in macrophages upon reversible inhibition of murine CMV by IFN-gamma. On the basis of molecular profiling of the reversible inhibition, we identify a significant contribution of a restricted type I IFN subnetwork linked with IFN-gamma activation. Genetic knockout of the type I-signaling pathway, in the context of IFN-gamma stimulation, revealed an essential requirement for a primed type I-signaling process in developing a full refractory state in macrophages. A minimal transient induction of IFN-beta upon macrophage activation with IFN-gamma is also detectable. In dose and kinetic viral replication inhibition experiments with IFN-gamma, the establishment of an antiviral effect is demonstrated to occur within the first hours of infection. We show that the inhibitory mechanisms at these very early times involve a blockade of the viral major immediate-early promoter activity. Altogether our results show that a primed type I IFN subnetwork contributes to an immediate-early antiviral state induced by type II IFN activation of macrophages, with a potential further amplification loop contributed by transient induction of IFN-beta.","2011-10","2025-01-16 09:57:22","2025-01-16 09:57:22","","10286-99","","19","85","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21775459","","","Edition: 2011/07/22","","","","Animals; Interferon Type I/*immunology; Interferon-gamma/*immunology; Macrophage Activation; Macrophages/*immunology/*virology; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muromegalovirus/*growth & development/*immunology; Signal Transduction; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Detailed understanding of the circadian network of higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, is hampered by the high number of partially redundant genes. However, the picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri, which was recently shown to possess a small number of non-redundant clock genes, presents an attractive alternative target for detailed modelling of circadian clocks in the green lineage. Based on extensive time-series data from in vivo reporter gene assays, we developed a model of the Ostreococcus clock as a feedback loop between the genes TOC1 and CCA1. The model reproduces the dynamics of the transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. Surprisingly, the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when the light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock circuit, it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions. Systematic screening of the effects of altered day length revealed a complex relationship between phase and photoperiod, which is also captured by the model. The complex light response is shown to stem from circadian gating of light-dependent mechanisms. This study provides insights into the contributions of light inputs to the Ostreococcus clock. The model suggests that a high number of light-dependent reactions are important for flexible timing in a circadian clock with only one feedback loop.","2011-04","2025-01-16 09:57:22","2025-01-16 09:57:22","","375-85","","2","66","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21219507","","","Edition: 2011/01/12","","","","*Circadian Clocks; Chlorophyta/genetics/physiology/*radiation effects; CLOCK Proteins/genetics/*radiation effects; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Light; Models, Biological; Photoperiod; Plant Proteins/genetics/*radiation effects; Transcription Factors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary PD are laid down at cytokinesis, while secondary PD arise during wall extension. During leaf development, the basal cell walls of trichomes extend radially without division, providing a convenient system for studying the origin of secondary PD. We devised a simple freeze-fracture protocol for examining large numbers of PD in surface view. In the postcytokinetic wall, simple PD were distributed randomly. As the wall extended, PD became twinned at the cell periphery. Additional secondary pores were inserted at right angles to these, giving rise to pit fields composed of several paired PD. During wall extension, the number of PD increased fivefold due to the insertion of secondary PD. Our data are consistent with a model in which a subset of the original primary PD pores function as templates for the insertion of new secondary PD, spatially fixing the position of future pit fields. Many of the new PD shared the same wall collar as the original PD pore, suggesting that new PD pores may arise by fissions of existing PD progenitors. Different models of secondary PD formation are discussed. Our data are supported by a computational model, Plasmodesmap, which accurately simulates the formation of radial pit fields during cell wall extension based on the occurrence of multiple PD twinning events in the cell wall. The model predicts PD distributions with striking resemblance to those seen on fractured wall faces.","2008-06","2025-01-16 09:57:22","2025-01-16 09:57:22","","1504-18","","6","20","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","18667640","","","Edition: 2008/08/01","","","","*Models, Biological; Cell Wall/metabolism/ultrastructure; Computer Simulation; Cytokinesis; Freeze Fracturing; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Plasmodesmata/*metabolism/ultrastructure; Tobacco/*metabolism/ultrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD; a flexible tail-like extension of the largest subunit) couples pre-messenger RNA capping, splicing and 3' end maturation to transcriptional elongation and termination, and plays a central role in integrating these processes. The phosphorylation states of the serine residues of many heptapeptide repeats of the CTD alter along the coding region of genes as a function of distance from the promoter. From a mechanistic perspective, both the changes in phosphorylation and the location at which they take place on the genes are a function of the time spent by RNAPII in elongation as this interval provides the opportunity for the kinases and phosphatases to interact with the CTD. On this basis, we synthesize the available data to create a kinetic model of the action of the known kinases and phosphatases to resolve the phosphorylation pathways and their kinetics.","2013","2025-01-16 09:57:22","2025-01-16 09:57:22","","20130438","","86","10","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","23804443","","","Edition: 2013/06/28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The clock functions by generating endogenous rhythms that can be entrained to the external 24-h day-night cycle, enabling organisms to optimally time biochemical processes relative to dawn and dusk. In recent years, computational models based on differential equations have become useful tools for dissecting and quantifying the complex regulatory relationships underlying the clock's oscillatory dynamics. However, optimizing the large parameter sets characteristic of these models places intense demands on both computational and experimental resources, limiting the scope of in silico studies. Here, we develop an approach based on Boolean logic that dramatically reduces the parametrization, making the state and parameter spaces finite and tractable. We introduce efficient methods for fitting Boolean models to molecular data, successfully demonstrating their application to synthetic time courses generated by a number of established clock models, as well as experimental expression levels measured using luciferase imaging. Our results indicate that despite their relative simplicity, logic models can (i) simulate circadian oscillations with the correct, experimentally observed phase relationships among genes and (ii) flexibly entrain to light stimuli, reproducing the complex responses to variations in daylength generated by more detailed differential equation formulations. Our work also demonstrates that logic models have sufficient predictive power to identify optimal regulatory structures from experimental data. By presenting the first Boolean models of circadian circuits together with general techniques for their optimization, we hope to establish a new framework for the systematic modelling of more complex clocks, as well as other circuits with different qualitative dynamics. In particular, we anticipate that the ability of logic models to provide a computationally efficient representation of system behaviour could greatly facilitate the reverse-engineering of large-scale biochemical networks.","2012-09-07","2025-01-16 09:57:22","2025-01-16 09:57:22","","2365-82","","74","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22499125","","","Edition: 2012/04/14","","","","*Models, Biological; *Photoperiod; Arabidopsis/*physiology; Circadian Clocks/*physiology; Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The computational modelling language Bio-PEPA enabled us to give a stochastic interpretation of an existing deterministic model of the clock, and to easily compare the results obtained via stochastic simulation and via numerical solution of the deterministic model. First, the introduction of stochasticity in the model allowed us to estimate the unknown size of the system. Moreover, stochasticity improved the description of the available experimental data in several light conditions: noise-induced fluctuations yield a faster entrainment of the plant clock under certain photoperiods and are able to explain the experimentally observed dampening of the oscillations in plants under constant light conditions. The model predicts that the desynchronization between noisy oscillations in single cells contributes to the observed damped oscillations at the level of the cell population.

Unexpectedly, this approach revealed a prominent role of negative feedback mechanisms during the immediate (</=60 min) IFNalpha response.

IFNgamma-induced repression of genes associated with regulation of gene expression, cellular development, apoptosis and cell growth resulted from cycloheximide-resistant primary IFNgamma signalling. In silico promoter analysis revealed significant overrepresentation of SP1/SP3-binding sites and/or GC-rich stretches. Although signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-binding sites were not overrepresented, repression was lost in absence of STAT1. Interestingly, basal expression of the majority of these IFNgamma-repressed genes was dependent on STAT1 in IFN-naive fibroblasts. Finally, IFNgamma-mediated repression was also found to be evident in primary murine macrophages.

Whereas telomerase activity can be reconstituted in vitro with only the telomerase RNA (hTR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), additional components are required in vivo for enzyme assembly, stability and telomere extension activity. One such associated protein, dyskerin, promotes hTR stability in vivo and is the only component to co-purify with active, endogenous human telomerase. We used oligonucleotide-based affinity purification of hTR followed by native gel electrophoresis and in-gel telomerase activity detection to query the composition of telomerase at different purification stringencies. At low salt concentrations (0.1 M NaCl), affinity-purified telomerase was 'supershifted' with an anti-dyskerin antibody, however the association with dyskerin was lost after purification at 0.6 M NaCl, despite the retention of telomerase activity and a comparable yield of hTR. The interaction of purified hTR and dyskerin in vitro displayed a similar salt-sensitive interaction. These results demonstrate that endogenous human telomerase, once assembled and active, does not require dyskerin for catalytic activity.

Not only do they frequently require a high level of computational power, but the software needed to run the experiment needs to be usable by scientists with varying levels of computational expertise, and modellers need to be able to obtain up-to-date experimental data resources easily. We have developed a software suite, the Systems Biology Software Infrastructure (SBSI), to facilitate the parameter-fitting process. SBSI is a modular software suite composed of three major components: SBSINumerics, a high-performance library containing parallelized algorithms for performing parameter fitting; SBSIDispatcher, a middleware application to track experiments and submit jobs to back-end servers; and SBSIVisual, an extensible client application used to configure optimization experiments and view results. Furthermore, we have created a plugin infrastructure to enable project-specific modules to be easily installed. Plugin developers can take advantage of the existing user-interface and application framework to customize SBSI for their own uses, facilitated by SBSI's use of standard data formats.

The method is based on a mixture model, using latent variables to assign individual measurements to different classes. The practical inference follows the Bayesian paradigm and samples the network structure, the number of classes and the assignment of latent variables from the posterior distribution with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using the recently proposed allocation sampler as an alternative to RJMCMC. RESULTS: We have evaluated the method using three criteria: network reconstruction, statistical significance and biological plausibility. In terms of network reconstruction, we found improved results both for a synthetic network of known structure and for a small real regulatory network derived from the literature. We have assessed the statistical significance of the improvement on gene expression time series for two different systems (viral challenge of macrophages, and circadian rhythms in plants), where the proposed new scheme tends to outperform the classical BGe score. Regarding biological plausibility, we found that the inference results obtained with the proposed method were in excellent agreement with biological findings, predicting dichotomies that one would expect to find in the studied systems.

As a result, the identification of proteins responsible for these changes is essential for the diagnostics and development of therapeutics. Transferring functional annotation within protein interaction networks has proven useful to identify such proteins, although this is not a trivial task. Here, we used different scoring methods to transfer annotation from 53 well-studied members of the human apoptosis pathways (as known by 2005) to their protein interactors. All scoring methods produced significant predictions (compared to a random negative model), but its number was too large to be useful. Thus, we made a final prediction using specific combinations of scoring methods and compared it to the proteins related to apoptosis signaling pathways during the last 5 years. We propose 273 candidate proteins that may be relevant in apoptosis signaling pathways.

Intron removal occurs in minutes and is best described by a model where several successive steps are rate limiting.

This report investigates the inference of Boolean networks with perturbation (BNp) from simulated data and observed microarray data. We interpret the discrete expression levels as attractor states of the underlying network and use the sequence of attractor states to determine the model. We consider the case where a complete sequence of attractors is known and the case where the known attractor states are arrived at by sampling from an underlying sequence of attractors. In the former case, a BNp can be inferred trivially, for an arbitrary number of genes and attractors. In the latter case, we use the constraints posed by the distribution of attractor states and the need to conserve probability to arrive at one of three possible solutions: an unique, exact network; several exact networks or a 'most-likely' network. In the case of several exact networks we use a robustness requirement to select a preferred network. In the case that an exact option is not found, we select the network that best fits the observed attractor distribution. We apply the resulting algorithm to the interferon regulatory network using expression data taken from murine bone-derived macrophage cells infected with cytomegalovirus.","2008-10","2025-01-16 09:57:23","2025-01-16 09:57:23","","1024-30","","10","4","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","19082142","","","Edition: 2008/12/17","","","","*Models, Genetic; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics; Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics; Interferons/*genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular phylogeny of mechanisms driving these rhythms has been difficult to dissect because identified clock genes and proteins are not conserved across the domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Here we show that oxidation-reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms.

In plants, attempted microbial infection triggers the rapid synthesis of nitric oxide and a parallel accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates, the latter generated by NADPH oxidases related to those responsible for the pathogen-activated respiratory burst in phagocytes. Both nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates have been implicated in controlling the hypersensitive response, a programmed execution of plant cells at sites of attempted infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin their function and coordinate their synthesis are unknown. Here we show genetic evidence that increases in cysteine thiols modified using nitric oxide, termed S-nitrosothiols, facilitate the hypersensitive response in the absence of the cell death agonist salicylic acid and the synthesis of reactive oxygen intermediates. Surprisingly, when concentrations of S-nitrosothiols were high, nitric oxide function also governed a negative feedback loop limiting the hypersensitive response, mediated by S-nitrosylation of the NADPH oxidase, AtRBOHD, at Cys 890, abolishing its ability to synthesize reactive oxygen intermediates. Accordingly, mutation of Cys 890 compromised S-nitrosothiol-mediated control of AtRBOHD activity, perturbing the magnitude of cell death development. This cysteine is evolutionarily conserved and specifically S-nitrosylated in both human and fly NADPH oxidase, suggesting that this mechanism may govern immune responses in both plants and animals.","2011-10-13","2025-01-16 09:57:23","2025-01-16 09:57:23","","264-8","","7368","478","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21964330","","","Edition: 2011/10/04","","","","*Plant Immunity; Animals; Apoptosis/*immunology; Arabidopsis Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Arabidopsis/cytology/enzymology/*immunology/*microbiology; Conserved Sequence; Cysteine/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Drosophila melanogaster; Feedback, Physiological; Humans; Mutant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Mutation; NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/metabolism; NADPH Oxidase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Nitric Oxide/metabolism; Plant Cells/*enzymology/*immunology/microbiology/pathology; Pseudomonas syringae/immunology; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Salicylic Acid; Sulfhydryl Compounds/chemistry/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This daily timekeeping is thought to be driven by transcriptional-translational feedback loops, whereby rhythmic expression of 'clock' gene products regulates the expression of associated genes in approximately 24-hour cycles. The specific transcriptional components differ between phylogenetic kingdoms. The unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri possesses a naturally minimized clock, which includes many features that are shared with plants, such as a central negative feedback loop that involves the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 genes. Given that recent observations in animals and plants have revealed prominent post-translational contributions to timekeeping, a reappraisal of the transcriptional contribution to oscillator function is overdue. Here we show that non-transcriptional mechanisms are sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage, although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional components. We identify oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in mammals. Moreover we show that pharmacological modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on rhythms in Ostreococcus. Post-translational mechanisms, and at least one rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than transcriptional clock regulators. It is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are non-transcriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria, and are conserved across kingdoms.","2011-01-27","2025-01-16 09:57:23","2025-01-16 09:57:23","","554-8","","7331","469","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21270895","","","Edition: 2011/01/29","","","","*Transcription, Genetic; Biological Markers/analysis; Chlorophyta/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; Cycloheximide/pharmacology; Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; Oxidation-Reduction; Peroxiredoxins/metabolism; Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our data demonstrate that two cryptochrome photoreceptors differentially control circadian period and sustain rhythmicity across the physiological temperature range. In order to test the hypothesis that the targets of light regulation are sufficient to mediate temperature compensation, we constructed a temperature-compensated clock model by adding passive temperature effects into only the light-sensitive processes in the model.

Known clock circuits include multiple, interlocked feedback loops. Theory suggested that multiple loops contribute the flexibility for molecular rhythms to track multiple phases of the external cycle. Clear dawn- and dusk-tracking rhythms illustrate the flexibility of timing in Ipomoea nil. Molecular clock components in Arabidopsis thaliana showed complex, photoperiod-dependent regulation, which was analysed by comparison with three contrasting models. A simple, quantitative measure, Dusk Sensitivity, was introduced to compare the behaviour of clock models with varying loop complexity. Evening-expressed clock genes showed photoperiod-dependent dusk sensitivity, as predicted by the three-loop model, whereas the one- and two-loop models tracked dawn and dusk, respectively.

This is referred to as temperature compensation, although recent work has suggested that the variation observed is a specific, adaptive control of period. Moreover, given that many biological rate constants have a Q(10) of around 2, it is remarkable that such clocks remain rhythmic under significant temperature changes. We introduce a new mathematical model for the Neurospora crassa circadian network incorporating experimental work showing that temperature alters the balance of translation between a short and long form of the FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein. This is used to discuss period control and functionality for the Neurospora system. The model reproduces a broad range of key experimental data on temperature dependence and rhythmicity, both in wild-type and mutant strains. We present a simple mechanism utilising the presence of the FRQ isoforms (isoform switching) by which period control could have evolved, and argue that this regulatory structure may also increase the temperature range where the clock is robustly rhythmic.","2008","2025-01-16 09:57:23","2025-01-16 09:57:23","","164","","","4","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","18277380","","","Edition: 2008/02/16","","","","Alleles; Biological Clocks/genetics/*physiology; Circadian Rhythm/genetics/*physiology; Computational Biology/methods; Computer Simulation; Feedback; Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology; Genes, Fungal; Kinetics; Models, Statistical; Mutation; Neurospora crassa/genetics/*physiology; Phosphorylation; Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism/physiology; Proteins/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Software; Temperature; Transcription, Genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major 5.8S 5'-end is generated by Rat1 digestion of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) spacer from cleavage site A(3). Processing from A(3) requires the 'A(3)-cluster' proteins, including Cic1, Erb1, Nop7, Nop12 and Nop15, which show interdependent pre-rRNA binding. Surprisingly, A(3)-cluster factors were not crosslinked close to site A(3), but bound sites around the 5.8S 3'- and 25S 5'-regions, which are base paired in mature ribosomes, and in the ITS2 spacer that separates these rRNAs. In contrast, Nop4, a protein required for endonucleolytic cleavage in ITS1, binds the pre-rRNA near the 5'-end of 5.8S. ITS2 was reported to undergo structural remodelling. In vivo chemical probing indicates that A(3)-cluster binding is required for this reorganization, potentially regulating the timing of processing.

Here, we present a proteome-scale method to quantify turnover and calculate synthesis and degradation rate constants of individual proteins in autotrophic organisms such as algae and plants. The workflow is based on the automated analysis of partial stable isotope incorporation with (15)N.

Mitochondrial targeted ATPases (0.14-0.16% h(-1)), photosystem antennae (0.09-0.14% h(-1)), and histones (0.07-0.1% h(-1)) were comparatively stable. The calculation of degradation and synthesis rate constants k(deg) and k(syn) confirms RbcL as the bulk contributor to overall protein turnover.

Populations are modelled using multi-level multisets; these contain both species and agents, with the latter possibly containing further such multisets. Rules are pairs of such multisets, but they may now also include variables (as well as species and agents), together with an associated stochastic rate. We give two illustrative examples. The first is an extracellular model of virus infection, coupled with an intracellular model of viral reproduction; this model can demonstrate successive waves of infection. The second is a model of cell division in which a repressor protein is diluted in successive generations, so eventually repression no longer occurs. The multi-level multiset approach can also be seen in terms of stochastic term rewriting for the theory of a commutative monoid equipped with extra constants (for the species) and unary operations (for the agents). We further discuss the relationship of this approach with two others: Krivine et al.'s stochastic bigraphs, restricted to Milner's place graphs, and Coppo et al.'s Stochastic Calculus of Wrapped Compartments.

In this paper, we enrich the stochastic process algebra Bio-PEPA, with the possibility of assigning delays to actions, yielding a new non-Markovian stochastic process algebra: Bio-PEPAd. This is a conservative extension meaning that the original syntax of Bio-PEPA is retained and the delay specification which can now be associated with actions may be added to existing Bio-PEPA models. The semantics of the firing of the actions with delays is the delay-as-duration approach, earlier presented in papers on the stochastic simulation of biological systems with delays. This semantics of the algebra is given in the Starting-Terminating style, meaning that the state and the completion of an action are observed as two separate events, as required by delays. We formally define the encoding of Bio-PEPAd systems in Generalized Semi-Markov Processes (GSMPs), as input for a Delay Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (DSSA) and as sets of Delay Differential Equations (DDEs), the deterministic framework for modeling of biological systems with delays. Finally, we prove theorems stating the relation between Bio-PEPA and Bio-PEPAd models. We end the paper with an example model of biological systems with delays to illustrate the approach.

This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, RNA polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced mRNA and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes.

This paper describes the global proteomic study of O. tauri, using mass spectrometry-based approaches: phosphopeptide enrichment, cellular fractionation, label-free quantification and (15)N metabolic labeling. The O. tauri proteome was analyzed under the following conditions: sampling at different times during the circadian cycle, after 24h of illumination, after 24h of darkness and under various nitrogen source supply levels. Cell cycle related proteins such as dynamin and kinesin were significantly up-regulated during the daylight-to-darkness transition. This is reflected by their higher intensity at ZT13 and this transition phase coincides with the end of mitosis. Proteins involved in several metabolic mechanisms were found to be up-regulated under low nitrogen conditions, including carbon storage pathways, glycolysis, phosphate transport, and the synthesis of inorganic polyphosphates. Ostreococcus tauri responds to low nitrogen conditions by reducing its nitrogen assimilation machinery which suggests an atypical adaptation mechanism for coping with a nutrient-limited environment.","2011-09-06","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","2060-70","","10","74","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21635980","","","Edition: 2011/06/04","","","","Chlorophyta/*chemistry/metabolism; Circadian Rhythm; Phosphopeptides/analysis; Plant Proteins/*analysis; Proteomics/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently global sensitivity analysis (GSA) has been recognised as a useful technique, capable of addressing the uncertainty of the model parameters and generating valid predictions on parametric sensitivities. Here we propose a novel implementation of model-based GSA specially designed to explore how multi-parametric network perturbations affect signal propagation through cancer-related networks. We use area-under-the-curve for time course of changes in phosphorylation of proteins as a characteristic for sensitivity analysis and rank network parameters with regard to their impact on the level of key cancer-related outputs, separating strong inhibitory from stimulatory effects. This allows interpretation of the results in terms which can incorporate the effects of potential anti-cancer drugs on targets and the associated biological markers of cancer. To illustrate the method we applied it to an ErbB signalling network model and explored the sensitivity profile of its key model readout, phosphorylated Akt, in the absence and presence of the ErbB2 inhibitor pertuzumab. The method successfully identified the parameters associated with elevation or suppression of Akt phosphorylation in the ErbB2/3 network. From analysis and comparison of the sensitivity profiles of pAkt in the absence and presence of targeted drugs we derived predictions of drug targets, cancer-related biomarkers and generated hypotheses for combinatorial therapy. Several key predictions have been confirmed in experiments using human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We also compared GSA-derived predictions with the results of local sensitivity analysis and discuss the applicability of both methods. We propose that the developed GSA procedure can serve as a refining tool in combinatorial anti-cancer drug discovery.","2012-07-16","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","244-58","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22085636","","","Edition: 2011/11/17","","","","*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; *Models, Biological; *Systems Biology; Algorithms; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology; Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology; Cell Line, Tumor; Computer Simulation; Drug Design; Female; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism; Receptor, erbB-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Receptor, erbB-3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Signal Transduction/*drug effects; Time Factors; Tumor Markers, Biological/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand how Expanded regulates Hippo pathway activity, we used affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify Expanded-binding proteins. Surprisingly we find that Yorkie is the major Expanded-binding protein in Drosophila S2 cells. Expanded binds Yorkie at endogenous levels via WW-domain-PPxY interactions, independently of Yorkie phosphorylation at S168, which is critical for 14-3-3 binding. Expanded relocalizes Yorkie from the nucleus, abrogating its nuclear activity, and it can regulate growth downstream of warts in vivo.

More recently, evidence from the unicellular eukaryote Ostreococcus tauri revealed a transcription-independent, rhythmic protein modification shared in anucleate human cells. In this study, the Ostreococcus system reveals a central role for targeted protein degradation in the mechanism of circadian timing. The Ostreococcus clockwork contains a TTFL involving the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 proteins. Cellular CCA1 and TOC1 protein content and degradation rates are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using luciferase reporter fusion proteins. CCA1 protein degradation rates, measured in high time resolution, feature a sharp clock-regulated peak under constant conditions. TOC1 degradation peaks in response to darkness. Targeted protein degradation, unlike transcription and translation, is shown to be essential to sustain TTFL rhythmicity throughout the circadian cycle.

EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) has been implicated as a repressor of light signaling to the clock [2, 3] and, paradoxically, as an activator of the light-induced genes CCA1 and LHY [4, 5]. We use cca1-11 lhy-21 elf3-4 plants to separate the repressive function of ELF3 from its downstream targets CCA1 and LHY. We further demonstrate that ELF3 associates physically with the promoter of PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9), a repressor of CCA1 and LHY expression, in a time-dependent fashion. The repressive function of ELF3 is thus consistent with indirect activation of LHY and CCA1, in a double-negative connection via a direct ELF3 target, PRR9.

The hypothesis that the core pacemakers of these clocks consist of auto-regulatory transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) was first developed in flies and fungi and has now been extended successfully to describe circadian timing mechanisms in mammals and plants. TTFL models revolve around the protein products of 'clock' genes that feedback periodically to regulate their own expression. From this simple beginning, the models have been expanded to encompass multiple, interlinked loops. However, experimental data now highlight the limitations of the TTFL model. Until recently, the focus on transcription caused rhythms in cytosolic signalling pathways to be viewed as outputs of the 'core' transcriptional clockwork, or else as a mechanism for its entrainment by extra-cellular stimuli. Recent work in Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals now reveals that cytosolic rhythms in small signalling molecules have a central role within the circadian pacemaker. The logic is consistent across taxa: oscillatory cytoplasmic elements integrate with transcriptional feedback loops to sustain them and determine their rhythmic properties. Thus, clock outputs can constitute inputs to subsequent cycles and so become indistinguishable from a core mechanism. This emphasises the interdependence of nuclear and cytoplasmic processes in circadian pacemaking, such that the pacemakers of some species might encompass the entire cell and its intercellular environment.","2008-09-09","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","R805-R815","","17","18","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","18786386","","","Edition: 2008/09/13","","","","*Circadian Rhythm; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cytosol/*metabolism; Feedback, Physiological; Gene Expression Regulation; Models, Genetic; Signal Transduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, statin based drugs, which form the principle pharmaceutical agents for decreasing the activity of this pathway, target a single enzyme. Here, we build an ordinary differential equation model of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in order to investigate how the two regulatory strategies impact upon the behaviour of the pathway. We employ a modest set of assumptions: that the pathway operates away from saturation, that each metabolite is involved in multiple cellular interactions and that mRNA levels reflect enzyme concentrations. Using data taken from primary bone marrow derived macrophage cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus or treated with IFNgamma, we show that, under these assumptions, coordinate down-regulation of enzyme activity imparts a graduated reduction in flux along the pathway. In contrast, modelling a statin-like treatment that achieves the same degree of down-regulation in cholesterol production, we show that this delivers a step change in flux along the pathway. The graduated reduction mediated by physiological coordinate regulation of multiple enzymes supports a mechanism that allows a greater level of specificity, altering cholesterol levels with less impact upon interactions branching from the pathway, than pharmacological step reductions. We argue that coordinate regulation is likely to show a long-term evolutionary advantage over single enzyme regulation. Finally, the results from our models have implications for future pharmaceutical therapies intended to target cholesterol production with greater specificity and fewer off target effects, suggesting that this can be achieved by mimicking the coordinated down-regulation observed in immunological responses.","2013-03","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","613-21","","3","95","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","22664637","","","Edition: 2012/06/06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to being much cheaper and faster than wet experiments, computer simulation has other advantages: it allows us to run experiments in which several species can be monitored at the same time, to explore quickly various conditions by varying species and parameters in different runs, and in some cases to observe the behavior of the system at a greater level of detail than the one permitted by experimental techniques. In the past few years there has been a considerable effort in the computer science community to develop computational languages and software tools for modeling and analysing biochemical systems. Among the challenges which must be addressed in this context, there are: the definition of languages powerful enough to express all the relevant features of biochemical systems, the development of efficient algorithms to analyze models and interpret the results, and the implementation of modeling platforms which are usable by nonprogrammers. In this chapter, we focus on the use of computational modeling to the analysis of biochemical systems. Computational modeling, in conjunction with the use of formal intuitive modeling languages, enables biologists to define models using a notation very similar to the informal descriptions they commonly use, but formal and, hence, automatically executable. We describe the main features of the existing textual computational languages and the tool support available for model development and analysis.","2011","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","217-51","","","487","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","21187227","","","Edition: 2010/12/29","","","","*Computer Simulation; *Models, Biological; Animals; Circadian Clocks/physiology; Humans; Janus Kinases/physiology; Signal Transduction; STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional MCMC schemes based on proposal moves in structure space tend to be too slow in mixing and convergence, and have recently been superseded by proposal moves in the space of node orders. A disadvantage of the latter approach is the intrinsic inability to specify the prior probability on network structures explicitly. The relative paucity of different experimental conditions in contemporary systems biology implies a strong influence of the prior probability on the posterior probability and, hence, the outcome of inference. Consequently, the paradigm of performing MCMC proposal moves in order rather than structure space is not entirely satisfactory. In the present article, we propose a new and more extensive edge reversal move in the original structure space, and we show that this significantly improves the convergence of the classical structure MCMC scheme.","2008-06","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","265-305","","2-3","71","","Mach Learn","","","","","","","","English","","","","ISI:000255788300006","","","","","","","bayesian networks; markov-chains; mcmc sampling; structure learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a standard data-dependent approach, we identified some specific peptides from this extract which were also commercially available in their AQUA form (use for absolute quantitation). For some of the peptides, we observed a non-linear response between the intensity and the added quantity which was then fitted using a quadratic fit. All AQUA peptides spiked into a mix of 3 microg of the HeLa cell digest extract were detected down to 16 fmol. We placed an emphasis on peptide detection which, in this study, is performed using a combination of properties such as three specific Q3-like ion signatures (for a given Q1-like selection) and co-elution with the AQUA peptide counterparts. Detecting a peptide without necessarily identifying it using a search engine imposes less constraint in terms of tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra purity. An example is shown where a peptide is detected using those criteria but could not be identified by Mascot due to its lower abundance. To complement this observation, we used a cross-correlation analysis approach in order to separate two populations of MS/MS fragments based on differences in their elution patterns. Such an approach opens the door to new strategies to analyse lower intensity peptide fragments. An in silico analysis of the human trypsinosome allows the evaluation of how unique are the sets of features that we are using for peptide detection.","2010-04-15","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","1093-104","","7","24","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20217656","","","Edition: 2010/03/11","","","","Amino Acid Sequence; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods; Computer Simulation; Cytoplasm/*chemistry; HeLa Cells; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Proteomics/methods; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Trypsin/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A network that contains 12 out of the 13 proteins was generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and this network is dominated (89%) by direct protein-protein interactions. This network scored 34 with IPA. Bootstrapping 1000 random lists of 13 proteins suggested that the frequency of this score occurring by chance was 1 in 500. We examined whether subsets of proteins such as HSPs, which were elevated after staurosporine, had a disproportionate impact on the network generated. There was no evidence that any subset of 8 from the 13 proteins contributed disproportionately to the network. Network generation, using IPA, identified common features (such as endoplasmic reticular stress protein interactions) in apoptotic studies from different laboratories.

Previously, wet-lab experiments and population genetic methods have been used to infer the sizes of effects of mutations. Both approaches have important limitations. Here we propose a new framework for estimating the DMEF by constructing fitness correlates in molecular systems biology models. This new framework can complement the other approaches in estimating small effects on fitness. We present a notation for the various DMEs that can be present in a molecular systems biology model. Then we apply this new framework to a simple circadian clock model and estimate various DMEs in that system. Circadian clocks are responsible for the daily rhythms of activity in a wide range of organisms. Mutations in the corresponding genes can have large effects on fitness by changing survival or fecundity. We define potential fitness correlates, describe methods for automatically measuring them from simulations and implement a simple clock using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm within StochKit. We determine what fraction of examined mutations with small effects on the rates of the reactions involved in this system are advantageous or deleterious for emerging features of the system like a fitness correlate, cycle length and cycle amplitude. We find that the DME can depend on the wild type reference used in its construction. Analyzing many models with our new approach will open up a third source of information about the distribution of mutational effects, one of the fundamental quantities that shape life.","2008","2025-01-16 09:57:24","2025-01-16 09:57:24","","156-175","","","5307","","Lect N Bioinformat","","","","","","","","English","","","","ISI:000260924200011","","","","","","","drosophila; models; networks; neurospora; rhythms; robustness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we focus on the simple circadian clock of the fungus Neurospora crassa. We use the Bio-PEPA process algebra to develop both a stochastic and a deterministic model of the system. The light on/off mechanism responsible for entrainment to the day/night cycle is expressed using discrete time-dependent events in Bio-PEPA. In order to validate our model, we compare it against the results of previous work which demonstrated that the deterministic model is in agreement with experimental data. Here we investigate the effect of stochasticity on the robustness of the clock's function in biological timing. In particular, we focus on the variations in the phase and amplitude of oscillations in circadian proteins with respect to different factors such as the presence/absence of a positive feedback loop, and the presence/absence of light.
