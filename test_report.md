# Network analysis report

## 1. Introduction
This report presents an analysis of a network dataset, focusing on key structural characteristics, group collaboration dynamics, and interdisciplinary.

## Network Description
Network Type is:
- **Undirected**: The network is undirected, meaning all connections are mutual. This is common in co-authorship or collaboration networks. In an undirected network, connections do not have a direction (e.g., if A is connected to B, then B might also be connected to A by definition).
